<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rough notes from which this narrative has
been constructed were given to me by the man
who tells the story. For obvious reasons I have
altered the names of the principals, and I hereby
pass on the assurance which I have received, that
the originals of such as are left alive can be found
if their discovery be thought desirable. This
alteration of names, the piecing together of somewhat
disconnected and sometimes nearly indecipherable
memoranda, and the reduction of the
mass to consecutive form, are all that has been
required of me or would have been permitted to
me. The expedition to Labrador mentioned by
the narrator has not returned, nor has it ever been
definitely traced. He does not undertake to prove
that it ever set out. But he avers that all which is
hereafter set down is truly told, and he leaves it
to mankind to accept the warning which it has
fallen to him to convey, or await the proof of its
sincerity which he believes the end of the century
will produce.</p>

<h1>THE CRACK OF DOOM</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE UNIVERSE A MISTAKE!</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> Universe is a mistake!"</p>

<p>Thus spake Herbert Brande, a passenger on the
<i>Majestic</i>, making for Queenstown Harbour, one
evening early in the past year. Foolish as the
words may seem, they were partly influential in
leading to my terrible association with him, and all
that is described in this book.</p>

<p>Brande was standing beside me on the starboard
side of the vessel. We had been discussing
a current astronomical essay, as we watched
the hazy blue line of the Irish coast rise on the
horizon. This conversation was interrupted by
Brande, who said, impatiently:</p>

<p>"Why tell us of stars distant so far from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
insignificant little world of ours&mdash;so insignificant
that even its own inhabitants speak disrespectfully
of it&mdash;that it would take hundreds of years
to telegraph to some of them, thousands to others,
and millions to the rest? Why limit oneself to
a mere million of years for a dramatic illustration,
when there is a star in space distant so far
from us that if a telegram left the earth for it
this very night, and maintained for ever its initial
velocity, it would never reach that star?"</p>

<p>He said this without any apparent effort after
rhetorical effect; but the suddenness with which he
had presented a very obvious truism in a fresh
light to me made the conception of the vastness
of space absolutely oppressive. In the hope of
changing the subject I replied:</p>

<p>"Nothing is gained by dwelling on these scientific
speculations. The mind is only bewildered.
The Universe is inexplicable."</p>

<p>"The Universe!" he exclaimed. "That is easily
explained. The Universe is a mistake!"</p>

<p>"The greatest mistake of the century, I suppose,"
I added, somewhat annoyed, for I thought
Brande was laughing at me.</p>

<p>"Say, of Time, and I agree with you," he
replied, careless of my astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not answer him for some moments.</p>

<p>This man Brande was young in years, but
middle-aged in the expression of his pale, intellectual
face, and old&mdash;if age be synonymous with
knowledge&mdash;in his ideas. His knowledge, indeed,
was so exhaustive that the scientific pleasantries
to which he was prone could always be justified,
dialectically at least, by him when he was
contradicted. Those who knew him well did not
argue with him. I was always stumbling into
intellectual pitfalls, for I had only known him
since the steamer left New York.</p>

<p>As to myself, there is little to be told. My
history prior to my acquaintance with Brande
was commonplace. I was merely an active,
athletic Englishman, Arthur Marcel by name. I
had studied medicine, and was a doctor in all but
the degree. This certificate had been dispensed
with owing to an unexpected legacy, on receipt
of which I determined to devote it to the furtherance
of my own amusement. In the pursuit
of this object, I had visited many lands and had
become familiar with most of the beaten tracks
of travel. I was returning to England after an
absence of three years spent in aimless roaming.
My age was thirty-one years, and my salient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
characteristic at the time was to hold fast by
anything that interested me, until my humour
changed. Brande's conversational vagaries had
amused me on the voyage. His extraordinary
comment on the Universe decided me to cement
our shipboard acquaintance before reaching port.</p>

<p>"That explanation of yours," I said, lighting
a fresh cigar, and returning to a subject which
I had so recently tried to shelve, "isn't it
rather vague?"</p>

<p>"For the present it must serve," he answered
absently.</p>

<p>To force him into admitting that his phrase
was only a thoughtless exclamation, or induce him
to defend it, I said:</p>

<p>"It does not serve any reasonable purpose. It
adds nothing to knowledge. As it stands, it is
neither academic nor practical."</p>

<p>Brande looked at me earnestly for a moment,
and then said gravely:</p>

<p>"The academic value of the explanation will
be shown to you if you will join a society I have
founded; and its practicalness will soon be made
plain whether you join or not."</p>

<p>"What do you call this club of yours?" I
asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"We do not call it a club. We call it a Society&mdash;the
<i>Cui Bono</i> Society," he answered coldly.</p>

<p>"I like the name," I returned. "It is
suggestive. It may mean anything&mdash;or nothing."</p>

<p>"You will learn later that the Society means
something; a good deal, in fact."</p>

<p>This was said in the dry, unemotional tone
which I afterwards found was the only sign of
displeasure Brande ever permitted himself to show.
His arrangements for going on shore at Queenstown
had been made early in the day, but he left
me to look for his sister, of whom I had seen
very little on the voyage. The weather had been
rough, and as she was not a good sailor, I had
only had a rare glimpse of a very dark and handsome
girl, whose society possessed for me a
strange attraction, although we were then almost
strangers. Indeed, I regretted keenly, as the
time of our separation approached, having registered
my luggage (consisting largely of curios
and mementoes of my travels, of which I was
very careful) for Liverpool. My own time was
valueless, and it would have been more agreeable
to me to continue the journey with the Brandes,
no matter where they went.</p>

<p>There was a choppy sea on when we reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the entrance to the harbour, so the <i>Majestic</i>
steamed in between the Carlisle and Camden forts,
and on to the man-of-war roads, where the tender
met us. By this time, Brande and his sister were
ready to go on shore; but as there was a heavy
mail to be transhipped, we had still an hour at
our disposal. For some time we paced the deck,
exchanging commonplaces on the voyage and
confidences as to our future plans. It was almost
dark, but not dark enough to prevent us from
seeing those wonderfully green hills which landlock
the harbour. To me the verdant woods and
hills were delightful after the brown plains and
interminable prairies on which I had spent many
months. As the lights of Queenstown began to
speck the slowly gathering gloom, Miss Brande
asked me to point out Rostellan Castle. It could
not be seen from the vessel, but the familiar
legend was easily recalled, and this led us to talk
about Irish tradition with its weird romance and
never failing pathos. This interested her. Freed
now from the lassitude of sea-sickness, the girl
became more fascinating to me every moment.
Everything she said was worth listening to, apart
from the charming manner in which it was said.</p>

<p>To declare that she was an extremely pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
girl would not convey the strange, almost unearthly,
beauty of her face&mdash;as intellectual as
her brother's&mdash;and of the charm of her slight but
exquisitely moulded figure. In her dark eyes
there was a sympathy, a compassion, that was
new to me. It thrilled me with an emotion
different from anything that my frankly happy,
but hitherto wholly selfish life had known. There
was only one note in her conversation which jarred
upon me. She was apt to drift into the extraordinary
views of life and death which were
interesting when formulated by her eccentric
brother, but pained me coming from her lips.
In spite of this, the purpose I had contemplated
of joining Brande's Society&mdash;evoked as it had
been by his own whimsical observation&mdash;now took
definite form. I would join that Society. It
would be the best way of keeping near to Natalie
Brande.</p>

<p>Her brother returned to us to say that the
tender was about to leave the ship. He had left
us for half an hour. I did not notice his absence
until he himself announced it. As we shook
hands, I said to him:</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about that Society of
yours. I mean to join it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very glad," he replied. "You will find
it a new sensation, quite outside the beaten track,
which you know so well."</p>

<p>There was a shade of half-kindly contempt
in his voice, which missed me at the moment.
I answered gaily, knowing that he would not
be offended by what was said in jest:</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall. If all the members are
as mad as yourself, it will be the most interesting
experience outside Bedlam that any
man could wish for."</p>

<p>I had a foretaste of that interest soon.</p>

<p>As Miss Brande was walking to the gangway,
a lamp shone full upon her gypsy face.
The blue-black hair, the dark eyes, and a deep
red rose she wore in her bonnet, seemed to me
an exquisite arrangement of harmonious colour.
And the thought flashed into my mind very
vividly, however trivial it may seem here, when
written down in cold words: "The queen of
women, and the queen of flowers." That is not
precisely how my thought ran, but I cannot
describe it better. The finer subtleties of the
brain do not bear well the daylight of
language.</p>

<p>Brande drew her back and whispered to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Then the sweet face, now slightly flushed, was
turned to me again.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you for that pretty thought," she
said with a pleasant smile. "You are too
flattering. The 'queen of flowers' is very true,
but the 'queen of women!' Oh, no!" She made
a graceful gesture of dissent, and passed down
the gangway.</p>

<p>As the tender disappeared into the darkness,
a tiny scrap of lace waved, and I knew
vaguely that she was thinking of me. But how
she read my thought so exactly I could not tell.</p>

<p>That knowledge it has been my fate to gain.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>A STRANGE EXPERIMENT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after my arrival in London, I called on
Brande, at the address he had given me in Brook
Street. He received me with the pleasant
affability which a man of the world easily
assumes, and his apology for being unable to
pass the evening with me in his own house was
a model of social style. The difficulty in the
way was practically an impossibility. His
Society had a meeting on that evening, and it
was imperative that he should be present.</p>

<p>"Why not come yourself?" he said. "It is
what we might call a guest night. That is,
visitors, if friends of members, are admitted,
and as this privilege may not be again accorded
to outsiders, you ought to come before you decide
finally to join us. I must go now, but Natalie"
(he did not say "Miss Brande") "will entertain
you and bring you to the hall. It is very near&mdash;in
Hanover Square."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be very glad indeed to bring Miss
Brande to the hall," I answered, changing the
sentence in order to correct Brande's too patronising
phrase.</p>

<p>"The same thing in different words, is it
not? If you prefer it that way, please have
it so." His imperturbability was unaffected.</p>

<p>Miss Brande here entered the room. Her brother,
with a word of renewed apology, left us, and
presently I saw him cross the street and hail
a passing hansom.</p>

<p>"You must not blame him for running off,"
Miss Brande said. "He has much to think of,
and the Society depends almost wholly on himself."</p>

<p>I stammered out that I did not blame him
at all, and indeed my disclaimer was absolutely
true. Brande could not have pleased me better
than he had done by relieving us of his company.</p>

<p>Miss Brande made tea, which I pretended to
enjoy in the hope of pleasing her. Over this
we talked more like old and well proven friends
than mere acquaintances of ten days' standing.
Just once or twice the mysterious chord which
marred the girl's charming conversation was
touched. She immediately changed the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
on observing my distress. I say distress, for a
weaker word would not fittingly describe the
emotion I felt whenever she blundered into the
pseudo-scientific nonsense which was her brother's
favourite affectation. At least, it seemed nonsense
to me. I could not well foresee then that
the theses which appeared to be mere theoretical
absurdities, would ever be proven&mdash;as they
have been&mdash;very terrible realities. On subjects
of ordinary educational interest my hostess displayed
such full knowledge of the question
and ease in dealing with it, that I listened, fascinated,
as long as she chose to continue speaking.
It was a novel and delightful experience to hear
a girl as handsome as a pictorial masterpiece,
and dressed like a court beauty, discourse with
the knowledge, and in the language, of the
oldest philosopher. But this was only one of
the many surprising combinations in her complex
personality. My noviciate was still in its first
stage.</p>

<p>The time to set out for the meeting arrived
all too soon for my inclination. We decided to
walk, the evening being fine and not too warm,
and the distance only a ten minutes' stroll. At
a street crossing, we met a crowd unusually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
large for that neighbourhood. Miss Brande
again surprised me. She was watching the
crowd seething and swarming past. Her dark
eyes followed the people with a strange wondering,
pitying look which I did not understand.
Her face, exquisite in its expression at all times,
was now absolutely transformed, beatified.
Brande had often spoken to me of mesmerism,
clairvoyance, and similar subjects, and it occurred
to me that he had used his sister as a medium,
a clairvoyante. Her brain was not, therefore,
under normal control. I determined instantly
to tell him on the first opportunity that if he
did not wish to see the girl permanently injured,
he would have to curtail his hypnotic
influence.</p>

<p>"It is rather a stirring sight," I said so sharply
to Miss Brande that she started. I meant to
startle her, but did not succeed as far as I
wished.</p>

<p>"It is a very terrible sight," she answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no danger," I said hastily, and
drew her hand over my arm.</p>

<p>"Danger! I was not thinking of danger."</p>

<p>As she did not remove her hand, I did not
infringe the silence which followed this, until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a break in the traffic allowed us to cross the
street. Then I said:</p>

<p>"May I ask what you were thinking of just
now, Miss Brande?"</p>

<p>"Of the people&mdash;their lives&mdash;their work&mdash;their
misery!"</p>

<p>"I assure you many are very happy," I replied.
"You take a morbid view. Misery is
not the rule. I am sure the majority are
happy."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?" the girl
said with a sigh. "What is the end of it
all&mdash;the meaning of it all? Their happiness!
<i>Cui Bono?</i>"</p>

<p>We walked on in silence, while I turned over
in my mind what she had said. I could come to
no conclusion upon it save that my dislike for her
enigmatic aberrations was becoming more intense
as my liking for the girl herself increased. To
change the current of her thoughts and my own,
I asked her abruptly:</p>

<p>"Are you a member of the <i>Cui Bono</i> Society?"</p>

<p>"I! Oh, no. Women are not allowed to
join&mdash;for the present."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it," I said heartily,
"and I hope the rule will continue in force."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise. "Why should
you mind? You are joining yourself."</p>

<p>"That is different. I don't approve of ladies
mixing themselves up in these curious and perhaps
questionable societies."</p>

<p>My remark amused her. Her eyes sparkled
with simple fun. The change in her manner was
very agreeable to me.</p>

<p>"I might have expected that." To my extreme
satisfaction she now looked almost mischievous.
"Herbert told me you were a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A little what?"</p>

<p>"Well, a little&mdash;you won't be vexed? That
is right. He said a little&mdash;medi&aelig;val."</p>

<p>This abated my appreciation of her sense of
humour, and I maintained a dignified reticence,
which unhappily she regarded as mere sullenness,
until we reached the Society's room.</p>

<p>The place was well filled, and the company,
in spite of the extravagantly modern costumes
of the younger women, which I cannot describe
better than by saying that there was little difference
in it from that of ordinary male attire,
was quite conventional in so far as the interchange
of ordinary courtesies went. When, however,
any member of the Society mingled with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a group of visitors, the conversation was soon
turned into a new channel. Secrets of science,
which I had been accustomed to look upon as
undiscoverable, were bandied about like the
merest commonplaces of education. The absurdity
of individuality and the subjectivity of
the emotions were alike insisted on without
notice of the paradox, which to me appeared extreme.
The Associates were altruistic for the
sake of altruism, not for the sake of its beneficiaries.
They were not pantheists, for they
saw neither universal good nor God, but rather
evil in all things&mdash;themselves included. Their
talk, however, was brilliant, and, with allowance
for its jarring sentiments, it possessed something
of the indefinable charm which followed Brande.
My reflections on this identity of interest were
interrupted by the man himself. After a word
of welcome he said:</p>

<p>"Let me show you our great experiment; that
which touches the high-water mark of scientific
achievement in the history of humanity. It is
not much in itself, but it is the pioneer of many
marvels."</p>

<p>He brought me to a metal stand, on which a
small instrument constructed of some white metal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was placed. A large number of wires were connected
with various portions of it, and these
wires passed into the side-wall of the building.</p>

<p>In appearance, this marvel of micrology, so
far as the eye-piece and upper portions went,
was like an ordinary microscope, but its magnifying
power was to me unbelievable. It magnified
the object under examination many thousand
times more than the most powerful microscope
in the world.</p>

<p>I looked through the upper lens, and saw a
small globe suspended in the middle of a tiny
chamber filled with soft blue light, or transparent
material. Circling round this globe four other
spheres revolved in orbits, some almost circular,
some elliptical, some parabolic. As I looked,
Brande touched a key, and the little globules
began to fly more rapidly round their primary,
and make wider sweeps in their revolutions.
Another key was pressed, and the revolving
spheres slowed down and drew closer until I
could scarcely distinguish any movement. The
globules seemed to form a solid ball.</p>

<p>"Attend now!" Brande exclaimed.</p>

<p>He tapped the first key sharply. A little grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
cloud obscured the blue light. When it cleared
away, the revolving globes had disappeared.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"What is it? What does it mean? Is it the
solar system or some other system illustrated
in miniature? I am sorry for the misadventure."</p>

<p>"You are partly correct," Brande replied. "It
is an illustration of a planetary system, though a
small one. But there was no misadventure. I
caused the somewhat dangerous result you witnessed,
the wreckage not merely of the molecule
of marsh gas you were examining&mdash;which any
educated chemist might do as easily as I&mdash;but
the wreckage of its constituent atoms. This is
a scientific victory which dwarfs the work of
Helmholtz, Avogadro, or Mendelejeff. The immortal
Dalton himself" (the word "immortal" was
spoken with a sneer) "might rise from his grave
to witness it."</p>

<p>"Atoms&mdash;molecules! What are you talking
about?" I asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"You were looking on at the death of a molecule&mdash;a
molecule of marsh gas, as I have already
said. It was caused by a process which I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
describe to you if I could reduce my own life
work&mdash;and that of every scientific amateur who
has preceded me since the world began&mdash;into
half a dozen sentences. As that would be difficult,
I must ask you to accept my personal assurance
that you witnessed a fact, not a fiction of my
imagination."</p>

<p>"And your instrument is so perfect that it not
only renders molecules and atoms but their diffusion
visible? It is a microscopic impossibility.
At least it is amazing."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" Brande exclaimed impatiently. "My
instrument does certainly magnify to a marvellous
extent, but not by the old device of the simple
microscope, which merely focussed a large area
of light rays into a small one. So crude a process
could never show an atom to the human eye.
I add much to that. I restore to the rays themselves
the luminosity which they lost in their
passage through our atmosphere. I give them
back all their visual properties, and turn them
with their full etheric blaze on the object under
examination. Great as that achievement is, I
deny that it is amazing. It may amaze a Papuan
to see his eyelash magnified to the size of a wire,
or an uneducated Englishman to see a cheese-mite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
magnified to the size of a midge. It should
not amaze you to see a simple process a little
further developed."</p>

<p>"Where does the danger you spoke of come
in?" I asked with a pretence of interest. Candidly,
I did not believe a single word that Brande
had said.</p>

<p>"If you will consult a common text-book on the
physics of the ether," he replied, "you will find
that one grain of matter contains sufficient energy,
if etherised, to raise a hundred thousand tons
nearly two miles. In face of such potentiality
it is not wise to wreck incautiously even the
atoms of a molecule."</p>

<p>"And the limits to this description of scientific
experiment? Where are they?"</p>

<p>"There are no limits," Brande said decisively.
"No man can say to science 'thus far and no
farther.' No man ever has been able to do so.
No man ever shall!"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>"IT IS GOOD TO BE ALIVE."</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the letters lying on my breakfast-table a
few days after the meeting was one addressed in
an unfamiliar hand. The writing was bold, and
formed like a man's. There was a faint trace of a
perfume about the envelope which I remembered.
I opened it first.</p>

<p>It was, as I expected, from Miss Brande. Her
brother had gone to their country place on the
southern coast. She and her friend, Edith Metford,
were going that day. Their luggage was already
at the station. Would I send on what I required
for a short visit, and meet them at eleven o'clock
on the bridge over the Serpentine? It was
enough for me. I packed a large portmanteau
hastily, sent it to Charing Cross, and spent the
time at my disposal in the park, which was close
to my hotel.</p>

<p>Although the invitation I had received gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me pleasure, I could not altogether remove from
my mind a vague sense of disquietude concerning
Herbert Brande and his Society. The
advanced opinions I had heard, if extreme, were
not altogether alarming. But the mysterious
way in which Brande himself had spoken
about the Society, and the still more mysterious
air which some of the members assumed
when directly questioned as to its object, suggested
much. Might it not be a revolutionary
party engaged in a grave intrigue&mdash;a
branch of some foreign body whose purpose
was so dangerous that ordinary disguises were
not considered sufficiently secure? Might they
not have adopted the jargon and pretended to
the opinions of scientific faddists as a cloak for
designs more sinister and sincere? The experiment
I witnessed might be almost a miracle or
merely a trick. Thinking it over thus, I could
come to no final opinion, and when I asked myself
aloud, "What are you afraid of?" I could not
answer my own question. But I thought I would
defer joining the Society pending further information.</p>

<p>A few minutes before eleven, I walked towards
the bridge over the Serpentine. No ladies appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to be on it. There were only a couple
of smartly dressed youths there, one smoking a
cigarette. I sauntered about until one of the
lads, the one who was not smoking, looked up
and beckoned to me. I approached leisurely, for
it struck me that the boy would have shown
better breeding if he had come toward me, considering
my seniority.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I did not notice you sooner. Why
did you not come on when you saw us?" the
smallest and slimmest youth called to me.</p>

<p>"In the name of&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;" I stammered.</p>

<p>"Brande; you haven't forgotten my name, I
hope," Natalie Brande said coolly. "This is my
friend, Edith Metford. Metford, this is Arthur
Marcel."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Marcel? I am glad to meet
you; I have heard 'favourable mention' of you
from the Brandes," the second figure in knickerbockers
said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir&mdash;madam&mdash;I mean&mdash;Miss&mdash;" I
blundered, and then in despair I asked
Miss Brande, "Is this a tableau vivant? What
is the meaning of these disguises?" My embarrassment
was so great that my discourteous
question may be pardoned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our dress! Surely you have seen women
rationally dressed before!" Miss Brande answered
complacently, while the other girl watched my
astonishment with evident amusement.</p>

<p>This second girl, Edith Metford, was a frank,
handsome young woman, but unlike the spirituelle
beauty of Natalie Brande. She was perceptibly
taller than her friend, and of fuller
figure. In consequence, she looked, in my opinion,
to even less advantage in her eccentric costume, or
rational dress, than did Miss Brande.</p>

<p>"Rationally dressed! Oh, yes. I know the
divided skirt, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Metford interrupted me. "Do you call
the divided skirt atrocity rational dress?" she
asked pointedly.</p>

<p>"Upon my honour I do not," I answered.</p>

<p>These girls were too advanced in their
ideas of dress for me. Nor did I feel
at all at my ease during this conversation,
which did not, however, appear to embarrass
them. I proposed hastily to get a cab, but
they demurred. It was such a lovely day, they
preferred to walk, part of the way at least. I
pointed out that there might be drawbacks to
this amendment of my proposal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"What drawbacks?" Miss Metford asked.</p>

<p>"For instance, isn't it probable we shall all be
arrested by the police?" I replied.</p>

<p>"Rubbish! We are not in Russia," both exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Which is lucky for you," I reflected, as we
commenced what was to me a most disagreeable
walk. I got them into a cab sooner than they
wished. At the railway station I did not offer
to procure their tickets. To do so, I felt, would
only give offence. Critical glances followed us
as we went to our carriage. Londoners are becoming
accustomed to varieties, if not vagaries, in
ladies' costumes, but the dress of my friends was
evidently a little out of the common even for
them. Miss Metford was just turning the handle
of a carriage door, when I interposed, saying,
"This is a smoking compartment."</p>

<p>"So I see. I am going to smoke&mdash;if you
don't object?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it would make any difference
if I did," I said, with unconscious asperity, for
indeed this excess of free manners was jarring
upon me. The line dividing it from vulgarity
was becoming so thin I was losing sight of the
divisor. Yet no one, even the most fastidious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
could associate vulgarity with Natalie Brande.
There remained an air of unassumed sincerity
about herself and all her actions, including even
her dress, which absolutely excluded her from
hostile criticism. I could not, however, extend
that lenient judgment to Miss Metford. The
girls spoke and acted&mdash;as they had dressed themselves&mdash;very
much alike. Only, what seemed
to me in the one a natural eccentricity, seemed
in the other an unnatural affectation.</p>

<p>I saw the guard passing, and, calling him over,
gave him half-a-crown to have the compartment
labelled, "Engaged."</p>

<p>Miss Brande, who had been looking out of the
window, absently asked my reason for this precaution.
I replied that I wanted the compartment
reserved for ourselves. I certainly did
not want any staring and otherwise offensive
fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>"We don't want all the seats," she persisted.</p>

<p>"No," I admitted. "We don't want the extra
seats. But I thought you might like the
privacy."</p>

<p>"The desire for privacy is an archaic emotion,"
Miss Metford remarked sententiously, as she
struck a match.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides, it is so selfish. We may be crowding
others," Miss Brande said quietly.</p>

<p>I was glad she did not smoke.</p>

<p>"I don't want that now," I said to a porter
who was hurrying up with a label. To the girls
I remarked a little snappishly, "Of course you
are quite right. You must excuse my ignorance."</p>

<p>"No, it is not ignorance," Miss Brande demurred.
"You have been away so much. You
have hardly been in England, you told me, for
years, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And progress has been marching in my absence,"
I interrupted.</p>

<p>"So it seems," Miss Metford remarked so significantly
that I really could not help retorting
with as much emphasis, compatible with politeness,
as I could command:</p>

<p>"You see I am therefore unable to appreciate
the New Woman, of whom I have heard so much
since I came home."</p>

<p>"The conventional New Woman is a grandmotherly
old fossil," Miss Metford said quietly.</p>

<p>This disposed of me. I leant back in my seat,
and was rigidly silent.</p>

<p>Miles of green fields stippled with daisies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bordered with long lines of white and red hawthorn
hedges flew past. The smell of new-mown
hay filled the carriage with its sweet perfume,
redolent of old associations. My long absence
dwindled to a short holiday. The world's wide
highways were far off. I was back in the English
fields. My slight annoyance passed away. I fell
into a pleasant day-dream, which was broken by a
soft voice, every undulation of which I already
knew by heart.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you think us very advanced," it
murmured.</p>

<p>"Very," I agreed, "but I look to you to bring
even me up to date."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we mean to do that, but we must proceed
very gradually."</p>

<p>"You have made an excellent start," I put
in.</p>

<p>"Otherwise you would only be shocked."</p>

<p>"It is quite possible." I said this with so much
conviction that the two burst out laughing at me.
I could not think of anything more to add, and I
felt relieved when, with a warning shriek, the
train dashed into a tunnel. By the time we had
emerged again into the sunlight and the solitude
of the open landscape I had ready an impromptu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
which I had been working at in the darkness. I
looked straight at Miss Metford and said:</p>

<p>"After all, it is very pleasant to travel with
girls like you."</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"You did not show any hysterical fear of my
kissing you in the tunnel."</p>

<p>"Why the deuce would you do that?" Miss
Metford replied with great composure, as she blew
a smoke ring.</p>

<p>When we reached our destination I braced myself
for another disagreeable minute or two. For
if the great Londoners thought us quaint, surely
the little country station idlers would swear we
were demented. We crossed the platform so
quickly that the wonderment we created soon
passed. Our luggage was looked after by a
servant, to whose care I confided it with a very
brief description. The loss of an item of it did
not seem to me of as much importance as our own
immediate departure.</p>

<p>Brande met us at his hall door. His house was
a pleasant one, covered with flowering creeping
plants, and surrounded by miniature forests. In
front there was a lake four hundred yards in
width. Close-shaven lawns bordered it. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were artificial products, no doubt, but they were
artificial successes&mdash;undulating, earth-scented, fresh
rolled every morning. Here there was an isolated
shrub, there a thick bank of rhododendrons. And
the buds, bursting into floral carnival, promised
fine contrasts when their full splendour was come.
The lake wavelets tinkled musically on a pebbly
beach.</p>

<p>Our host could not entertain us in person. He
was busy. The plea was evidently sincere, notwithstanding
that the business of a country
gentleman&mdash;which he now seemed to be&mdash;is something
less exacting than busy people's leisure.
After a short rest, and an admirably-served
lunch, we were dismissed to the woods for our
better amusement.</p>

<p>Thereafter followed for me a strangely peaceful,
idyllic day&mdash;all save its ending. Looking back
on it, I know that the sun which set that evening
went down on the last of my happiness. But it
all seems trivial now.</p>

<p>My companions were accomplished botanists,
and here, for the first time, I found myself on
common ground with both. We discussed every
familiar wild flower as eagerly as if we had been
professed field naturalists. In walking or climbing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
my assistance was neither requisitioned nor required.
I did not offer, therefore, what must
have been unwelcome when it was superfluous.</p>

<p>We rested at last under the shade of a big
beech, for the afternoon sun was rather oppressive.
It was a pleasant spot to while away an
hour. A purling brook went babbling by, singing
to itself as it journeyed to the sea. Insects droned
about in busy flight. There was a perfume of
honeysuckle wafted to us on the summer wind,
which stirred the beech-tree and rustled its young
leaves lazily, so that the sunlight peeped through
the green lattice-work and shone on the faces of
these two handsome girls, stretched in graceful
postures on the cool sward below&mdash;their white
teeth sparkling in its brilliance, while their soft
laughter made music for me. In the fulness of
my heart, I said aloud:</p>

<p>"It is a good thing to be alive."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>GEORGE DELANY&mdash;DECEASED.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> is a good thing to be alive," Natalie Brande
repeated slowly, gazing, as it were, far off through
her half-closed eyelids. Then turning to me
and looking at me full, wide-eyed, she asked:
"A good thing for how many?"</p>

<p>"For all; for everything that is alive."</p>

<p>"Faugh! For few things that are alive. For
hardly anything. You say it is a good thing
to be alive. How often have you said that in
your life?"</p>

<p>"All my life through," I answered stoutly.
My constitution was a good one, and I had lived
healthily, if hardily. I voiced the superfluous
vitality of a well nourished body.</p>

<p>"Then you do not know what it is to feel
for others."</p>

<p>There was a scream in the underwood near
us. It ended in a short, choking squeak. The
girl paled, but she went on with outward calm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"That hawk or cat feels as you do. I wonder
what that young rabbit thinks of life's problem?"</p>

<p>"But we are neither hawks nor cats, nor even
young rabbits," I answered warmly. "We can
not bear the burthens of the whole animal world.
Our own are sufficient for us."</p>

<p>"You are right. They are more than sufficient."</p>

<p>I had made a false move, and so tried to recover
my lost ground. She would not permit me.
The conversation which had run in pleasant
channels for two happy hours was ended.
Thenceforth, in spite of my obstructive efforts,
subjects were introduced which could not be
conversed on but must be discussed. On every
one Miss Brande took the part of the weak against
the strong, oblivious of every consideration of
policy and even ethics, careful only that she
championed the weak because of their weakness.
Miss Metford abetted her in this, and went
further in their joint revolt against common
sense. Miss Brande was argumentative, pleading.
Miss Metford was defiant. Between the two I
fared ill.</p>

<p>Of course the Woman question was soon introduced,
and in this I made the best defence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of time-honoured customs of which I was capable.
But my outworks fell down as promptly before
the voices of these young women as did the
walls of Jericho before the blast of a ram's horn.
Nothing that I had cherished was left to me.
Woman no longer wanted man's protection.
("Enslavement" they called it.) Why should she,
when in the evolution of society there was not
now, or presently would not be, anything from
which to protect her? ("Competing slaveowners"
was what they said.) When you wish to behold
protectors you must postulate dangers. The
first are valueless save as a preventive of the
second. Both evils will be conveniently dispensed
with. All this was new to me, most of my
thinking life having been passed in distant
lands, where the science of ethics is codified into
a simple statute&mdash;the will of the strongest.</p>

<p>When my dialectical humiliation was within
one point of completion, Miss Metford came to
my rescue. For some time she had looked on at
my discomfiture with a good-natured neutrality,
and when I was metaphorically in my last ditch,
she arose, stretched her shapely figure, flicked
some clinging grass blades from her suit, and
declared it was time to return. Brande was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
man of science, but as such he was still amenable
to punctuality in the matter of dinner.</p>

<p>On the way back I was discreetly silent.
When we reached the house I went to look for
Herbert Brande. He was engaged in his study,
and I could not intrude upon him there. To do
so would be to infringe the only rigid rule in
his household. Nor had I an opportunity of
speaking to him alone until after dinner, when I
induced him to take a turn with me round the
lake. I smoked strong cigars, and made one of
these my excuse.</p>

<p>The sun was setting when we started, and as
we walked slowly the twilight shadows were
deepening fast by the time we reached the further
shore. Brande was in high spirits. Some new
scientific experiment, I assumed, had come off
successfully. He was beside himself. His conversation
was volcanic. Now it rumbled and
roared with suppressed fires. Anon, it burst forth
in scintillating flashes and shot out streams of
quickening wit. I have been his auditor in the
three great epochs of his life, but I do not think
that anything that I have recollected of his
utterances equals the bold impromptus, the masterly
handling of his favourite subject, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Universe, which fell from him on that evening.
I could not answer him. I could not even follow
him, much less suppress him. But I had come
forth with a specific object in view, and I would
not be gainsaid. And so, as my business had
to be done better that it should be done quickly.
Taking advantage of a pause which he made,
literally for breath, I commenced abruptly:</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you about your sister."</p>

<p>He turned on me surprised. Then his look
changed to one of such complete contempt, and
withal his bearing suggested so plainly that he
knew beforehand what I was going to say, that
I blurted out defiantly, and without stopping to
choose my words:</p>

<p>"I think it an infernal shame that you, her
brother, should allow her to masquerade about
with this good-natured but eccentric Metford girl&mdash;I
should say Miss Metford."</p>

<p>"Why so?" he asked coldly.</p>

<p>"Because it is absurd; and because it isn't
decent."</p>

<p>"My dear Abraham," Brande said quietly, "or
is your period so recent as that of Isaac or Jacob?
My sister pleases herself in these matters, and
has every right to do so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has not. You are her brother."</p>

<p>"Very well, I am her brother. She has no
right to think for herself; no right to live save
by my permission. Then I graciously permit her
to think, and I allow her to live."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry for this nonsense sooner or
later&mdash;and don't say I didn't warn you." The
absolute futility of my last clause struck me
painfully at the moment, but I could not think
of any way to better it. It was hard to reason
with such a man, one who denied the fundamental
principles of family life. I was thinking over
what to say next, when Brande stopped and put
his hand, in a kindly way, upon my shoulder.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," he said, "what does it
matter? What do the actions of my sister
signify more than the actions of any other
man's sister? And what about the Society?
Have you made up your mind about joining?"</p>

<p>"I have. I made it up twice to-day," I answered.
"I made it up in the morning that I
would see yourself and your Society to the
devil before I would join it. Excuse my bluntness;
but you are so extremely candid yourself
you will not mind."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, I do not mind bluntness. Rudeness
is superfluous."</p>

<p>"And I made it up this evening," I said, a
little less aggressively, "that I would join it if
the devil himself were already in it, as I half
suspect he is."</p>

<p>"I like that," Brande said gravely. "That is
the spirit I want in the man who joins
me."</p>

<p>To which I replied: "What under the sun is
the object of this Society of yours?"</p>

<p>"Proximately to complete our investigations&mdash;already
far advanced&mdash;into the origin of the
Universe."</p>

<p>"And ultimately?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you now. You will not know
that until you join us."</p>

<p>"And if your ultimate object does not suit
me, I can withdraw?"</p>

<p>"No, it would then be too late."</p>

<p>"How so? I am not morally bound by an
oath which I swear without full knowledge of
its consequences and responsibilities."</p>

<p>"Oath! The oath you swear! You swear no
oath. Do you fancy you are joining a society
of Rechabites or Carmelites, or medi&aelig;val rubbish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of that kind. Don't keep so painstakingly behind
the age."</p>

<p>I thought for a moment over what this mysterious
man had said, over the hidden dangers
in which his mad chimeras might involve the
most innocent accomplice. Then I thought of
that dark-eyed, sweet-voiced, young girl, as
she lay on the green grass under the beech-tree
in the wood and out-argued me on every
point. Very suddenly, and, perhaps, in a manner
somewhat grandiose, I answered him:</p>

<p>"I will join your Society for my own purpose,
and I will quit it when I choose."</p>

<p>"You have every right," Brande said carelessly.
"Many have done the same before
you."</p>

<p>"Can you introduce me to any one who has
done so?" I asked, with an eagerness that could
not be dissembled.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can not."</p>

<p>"Or give me an address?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, that is simple." He turned over a
note-book until he found a blank page. Then
he drew the pencil from its loop, put the point
to his lips, and paused. He was standing with
his back to the failing light, so I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
see the expression of his mobile face. When
he paused, I knew that no ordinary doubt beset
him. He stood thus for nearly a minute.
While he waited, I watched a pair of swans
flit ghost-like over the silken surface of the
lake. Between us and a dark bank of wood
the lights of the house flamed red. The melancholy
even-song of a blackbird wailed out from
a shrubbery beside us. Then Herbert Brande
wrote in his note-book, and tearing out the
page, he handed it to me, saying: "That is
the address of the last man who quitted us."</p>

<p>The light was now so dim I had to hold
the paper close to my eyes in order to read
the lines. They were these&mdash;</p>

<div class="bk1"><span class="smcap">George Delany</span>,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>THE MURDER CLUB.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Delany</span> was the last man who quitted us&mdash;you
see I use your expression again. I like it," Brande
said quietly, watching me as he spoke.</p>

<p>I stood staring at the slip of paper which I
held in my hand for some moments before I could
reply. When my voice came back, I asked
hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Did this man, Delany, die suddenly after
quitting the Society?"</p>

<p>"He died immediately. The second event
was contemporaneous with the first."</p>

<p>"And in consequence of it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Have all the members who retired from your
list been equally short-lived?"</p>

<p>"Without any exception whatever."</p>

<p>"Then your Society, after all your high-flown
talk about it, is only a vulgar murder club,"
I said bitterly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wrong in fact, and impertinent in its expression.
It is not a murder club, and&mdash;well,
you are the first to discover its vulgarity."</p>

<p>"I call things by their plain names. You
may call your Society what you please. As to
my joining it in face of what you have told
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is more than was ever told to any
man before he joined&mdash;to any man living or
dead. And more, you need not join it yet unless
you still wish to do so. I presume what I
have said will prevent you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, if I had any doubt, or if
there was any possibility of my wavering before
this interview, there is none now. I join at
once."</p>

<p>He would have taken my hand, but that I
could not permit. I left him without another
word, or any form of salute, and returned to the
house. I did not appear again in the domestic
circle that evening, for I had enough upon my
mind without further burdening myself with
social pretences.</p>

<p>I sat in my room and tried once more to
consider my position. It was this: for the sake
of a girl whom I had only met some score of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
times; who sometimes acted, talked, dressed after
a fashion suggestive of insanity; who had glorious
dark eyes, a perfect figure, and an exquisitely
beautiful face&mdash;but I interrupt myself. For the
sake of this girl, and for the manifestly impossible
purpose of protecting her from herself as
well as others, I had surrendered myself to the
probable vengeance of a band of cut-throats
if I betrayed them, and to the certain vengeance
of the law if I did not. Brande,
notwithstanding his constant scepticism, was
scrupulously truthful. His statement of fact
must be relied upon. His opinions were another
matter. As nothing practical resulted
from my reflections, I came to the conclusion
that I had got into a pretty mess for the sake
of a handsome face. I regretted this result,
but was glad of the cause of it. On this I
went to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning I was early astir, for I must
see Natalie Brande without delay, and I felt
sure she would be no sluggard on that splendid
summer day. I tried the lawn between the
house and the lake shore. I did not find her
there. I found her friend Miss Metford. The
girl was sauntering about, swinging a walking-cane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
carelessly. She was still rationally dressed,
but I observed with relief that the rational
part of her costume was more in the nature of
the divided skirt than the plain knickerbockers
of the previous day. She accosted me cheerfully
by my surname, and not to be outdone by her, I
said coolly:</p>

<p>"How d'ye do, Metford?"</p>

<p>"Very well, thanks. I suppose you expected
Natalie? You see you have only me."</p>

<p>"Delighted," I was commencing with a forced
smile, when she stopped me.</p>

<p>"You look it. But that can't be helped.
Natalie saw you going out, and sent me to meet
you. I am to look after you for an hour or
so. You join the Society this evening, I hear.
You must be very pleased&mdash;and flattered."</p>

<p>I could not assent to this, and so remained
silent. The girl chattered on in her own outspoken
manner, which, now that I was growing
accustomed to it, I did not find as unpleasant
as at first. One thing was evident to me. She
had no idea of the villainous nature of
Brande's Society. She could not have spoken
so carelessly if she shared my knowledge of it.
While she talked to me, I wondered if it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fair to her&mdash;a likeable girl, in spite of her undesirable
affectations of advanced opinion, emancipation
or whatever she called it&mdash;was it fair
to allow her to associate with a band of murderers,
and not so much as whisper a word of warning?
No doubt, I myself was associating with the
band; but I was not in ignorance of the responsibility
thereby incurred.</p>

<p>"Miss Metford," I said, without heeding whether
I interrupted her, "are you in the secret of this
Society?"</p>

<p>"I? Not at present. I shall be later on."</p>

<p>I stopped and faced her with so serious an
expression that she listened to me attentively.</p>

<p>"If you will take my earnest advice&mdash;and I beg
you not to neglect it&mdash;you will have nothing to
do with it or any one belonging to it."</p>

<p>"Not even Brande&mdash;I mean Natalie? Is she
dangerous?"</p>

<p>I disregarded her mischief and continued:
"If you can get Miss Brande away from her
brother and his acquaintances," (I had nearly
said accomplices,) "and keep her away, you would
be doing the best and kindest thing you ever
did in your life."</p>

<p>Miss Metford was evidently impressed by my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
seriousness, but, as she herself said very truly,
it was unlikely that she would be able to interfere
in the way I suggested. Besides, my mysterious
warning was altogether too vague to be of any
use as a guide for her own action, much less
that of her friend. I dared not speak plainer.
I could only repeat, in the most emphatic words,
my anxiety that she would think carefully over
what I had said. I then pretended to recollect
an engagement with Brande, for I was in such
low spirits I had really little taste for any company.</p>

<p>She was disappointed, and said so in her usual
straightforward way. It was not in the power of
any gloomy prophecy to oppress her long. The
serious look which my words had brought on
her face passed quickly, and it was in her natural
manner that she bade me good-morning, saying:</p>

<p>"It is rather a bore, for I looked forward to
a pleasant hour or two taking you about."</p>

<p>I postponed my breakfast for want of appetite,
and, as Brande's house was the best example
of Liberty Hall I had ever met with, I offered
no apology for my absence during the entire
day when I rejoined my host and hostess in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the evening. The interval I spent in the woods,
thinking much and deciding nothing.</p>

<p>After dinner, Brande introduced me to a man
whom he called Edward Grey. Natalie conducted
me to the room in which they were
engaged. From the mass of correspondence
in which this man Grey was absorbed, and the
litter of papers about him, it was evident that
he must have been in the house long before I
made his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Grey handed me a book, which I found to
be a register of the names of the members of
Brande's Society, and pointed out the place for
my signature.</p>

<p>When I had written my name on the list I
said to Brande: "Now that I have nominated
myself, I suppose you'll second me?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," he answered; "you are
already a member. Your remark to Miss Metford
this morning made you one of us. You advised
her, you recollect, to beware of us."</p>

<p>"That girl!" I exclaimed, horrified. "Then
she is one of your spies? Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"No, she is not one of our spies. We have
none, and she knew nothing of the purpose for
which she was used."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I beg to say that you have made a
d&mdash;d shameful use of her."</p>

<p>In the passion of the moment I forgot my
manners to my host, and formed the resolution
to denounce the Society to the police the moment
I returned to London. Brande was not offended
by my violence. There was not a trace of anger
in his voice as he said:</p>

<p>"Miss Metford's information was telepathically
conveyed to my sister."</p>

<p>"Then it was your sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My sister knows as little as the other. In
turn, I received the information telepathically from
her, without the knowledge of either. I was just
telling Grey of it when you came into the room."</p>

<p>"And," said Grey, "your intention to go
straight from this house to Scotland Yard, there
to denounce us to the police, has been telepathically
received by myself."</p>

<p>"My God!" I cried, "has a man no longer
the right to his own thoughts?"</p>

<p>Grey went on without noticing my exclamation:
"Any overt or covert action on your
part, toward carrying out your intention, will
be telepathically conveyed to us, and our executive&mdash;"
He shrugged his shoulders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," I said, "Woking Cemetery, near
Saint Anne's Chapel. You have ground there."</p>

<p>"Yes, we have to dispense with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say murder."</p>

<p>"Dispense with," Grey repeated sharply, "any
member whose loyalty is questionable. This
is not our wish; it is our necessity. It is the
only means by which we can secure the absolute
immunity of the Society pending the achievement
of its object. To dispense with any living
man we have only to will that he shall die."</p>

<p>"And now that I am a member, may I ask
what is this object, the secret of which you
guard with such fiendish zeal?" I demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>"The restoration of a local etheric tumour to
its original formation."</p>

<p>"I am already weary of this jargon from
Brande," I interrupted. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"We mean to attempt the reduction of the
solar system to its elemental ether."</p>

<p>"And you will accomplish this triviality by
means of Huxley's comet, I suppose?"</p>

<p>I could scarcely control my indignation. This
fooling, as I thought it, struck me as insulting.
Neither Brande nor Grey appeared to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
notice my keen resentment. Grey answered me
in a quiet, serious tone.</p>

<p>"We shall attempt it by destroying the
earth. We may fail in the complete achievement
of our design, but in any case we shall
at least be certain of reducing this planet to
the ether of which it is composed."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," I agreed derisively.
"You will at least make sure of that. You
have found out how to do it too, I have no
doubt?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grey, "we have found out."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>A TELEPATHIC TELEGRAM.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I left</span> the room and hurried outside without any
positive plan for my movements. My brain was
in such a whirl I could form no connected train of
thought. These men, whose conversation was a
jargon fitting only for lunatics, had proved that
they could read my mind with the ease of a
telegraph operator taking a message off a wire.
That they, further, possessed marvellous, if not
miraculous powers, over occult natural forces
could hardly be doubted. The net in which I
had voluntarily entangled myself was closing
around me. An irresistible impulse to fly&mdash;to
desert Natalie and save myself&mdash;came over me.
I put this aside presently. It was both unworthy
and unwise. For whither should I fly? The
ends of the earth would not be far enough to
save me, the depths of the sea would not be deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
enough to hide me from those who killed by
willing that their victim should die.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if my senses had only been
hocussed, and Messrs. Brande and Grey were
nothing better than clever tricksters, the park
gate was far enough, and the nearest policeman
force enough, to save me from their vengeance.
But the girl&mdash;Natalie! She was clairvoyante.
They practised upon her. My diagnosis of the
strange seeing-without-sight expression of her
eyes was then correct. And it was clear to me
that whatsoever or whomsoever Brande and Grey
believed or disbelieved in, they certainly believed
in themselves. They might be relied on to spare
nothing and no one in their project, however
ridiculous or mad their purpose might be. What
then availed my paltry protection when the girl
herself was a willing victim, and the men omnipotent?
Nevertheless, if I failed eventually to
serve her, I could at least do my best.</p>

<p>It was clear that I must stand by Natalie
Brande.</p>

<p>While I was thus reflecting, the following conversation
took place between Brande and Grey.
I found a note of it in a diary which Brande
kept desultorily. He wrote this up so irregularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
no continuous information can be gleaned from it
as to his life. How the diary came into my hands
will be seen later. The memorandum is written
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grey</i>&mdash;Our new member? Why did you introduce
him? You say he cannot help with
money. It is plain he cannot help with brains.</p>

<p><i>Brande</i>&mdash;He interests Natalie. He is what the
uneducated call good-natured. He enjoys doing
unselfish things, unaware that it is for the selfish
sake of the agreeable sensation thereby secured.
Besides, I like him myself. He amuses me. To
make him a member was the only safe way of
keeping him so much about us. But Natalie is
the main reason. I am afraid of her wavering in
spite of my hypnotic influence. In a girl of her
intensely emotional nature the sentiment of hopeless
love will create profound melancholy. Dominated
by that she is safe. It seems cruel at first
sight. It is not really so. It is not cruel to
reconcile her to a fate she cannot escape. It is
merciful. For the rest, what does it matter? It
will be all the same in&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grey</i>&mdash;This day six months.</p>

<p><i>Brande</i>&mdash;I believe I shivered. Heredity has
much to answer for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>That is the whole of the entry. I did not read
the words until the hand that wrote them was
dust.</p>

<p>Natalie professed some disappointment when I
announced my immediate return to town. I
was obliged to manufacture an excuse for such
a hasty departure, and so fell back on an old
engagement which I had truly overlooked, and
which really called me away. But it would
have called long enough without an answer if
it had not been for Brande himself, his friend
Grey, and their insanities. My mind was fixed
on one salient issue: how to get Natalie Brande
out of her brother's evil influence. This would
be better compassed when I myself was outside
the scope of his extraordinary influence. And so
I went without delay.</p>

<p>For some time after my return to London, I
went about visiting old haunts and friends. I
soon tired of this. The haunts had lost their
interest. The friends were changed, or I was
changed. I could not resume the friendships
which had been interrupted. The chain of connection
had been broken and the links would
not weld easily. So, after some futile efforts to
return to the circle I had long deserted, I desisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and accepted my exclusion with serenity. I am
not sure that I desired the old relationships re-established.
And as my long absence had prevented
any fresh shoots of friendship being grafted,
I found myself alone in London. I need say no
more.</p>

<p>One evening I was walking through the streets
in a despondent mood, as had become my habit.
By chance I read the name of a street into which
I had turned to avoid a more crowded thoroughfare.
It was that in which Miss Metford lived. I
knew that she had returned to town, for she
had briefly acquainted me with the fact on a postcard
written some days previously.</p>

<p>Here was a chance of distraction. This girl's
spontaneous gaiety, which I found at first displeasing,
was what I wanted to help me to shake
off the gloomy incubus of thought oppressing me.
It was hardly within the proprieties to call upon
her at such an hour, but it could not matter very
much, when the girl's own ideas were so unconventional.
She had independent means, and lived
apart from her family in order to be rid of
domestic limitations. She had told me that she
carried a latch-key&mdash;indeed she had shown it to
me with a flourish of triumph&mdash;and that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
delighted in free manners. Free manners, she
was careful to add, did not mean bad manners.
To my mind the terms were synonymous. When
opposite her number I decided to call, and, having
knocked at the door, was told that Miss Metford
was at home.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Marcel! Glad to see you," she called
out, somewhat stridently for my taste. Her
dress was rather mannish, as usual. In lieu of
her out-door tunic she wore a smoking-jacket.
When I entered she was sitting in an arm-chair,
with her feet on a music-stool. She arose so
hastily that the music-stool was overturned, and
allowed to lie where it fell.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked, concerned.
"Have you seen a ghost?"</p>

<p>"I think I have seen many ghosts of late," I said,
"and they have not been good company. I was
passing your door, and I have come in for comfort."</p>

<p>She crossed the room and poured out some
whisky from a decanter which was standing on a
side-board. Then she opened a bottle of soda-water
with a facility which suggested practice. I
was relieved to think that it was not Natalie who
was my hostess. Handing me the glass, she said
peremptorily:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Drink that. That is right. Give me the glass.
Now smoke. Do I allow smoking here? Pah!
I smoke here myself."</p>

<p>I lit a cigar and sat down beside her. The
clouds began to lift from my brain and float off
in the blue smoke wreaths. We talked on ordinary
topics without my once noticing how deftly they
had been introduced by Miss Metford. I never
thought of the flight of time until a chime from
a tiny clock on the mantelpiece&mdash;an exquisite
sample of the tasteful furniture of the whole room&mdash;warned
me that my visit had lasted two hours.
I arose reluctantly.</p>

<p>She rallied me on my ingratitude. I had come
in a sorry plight. I was now restored. She was
no longer useful, therefore I left her. And so on,
till I said with a solemnity no doubt lugubrious:</p>

<p>"I am most grateful, Miss Metford. I cannot
tell you how grateful I am. You would not
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please leave my poor understanding alone,
and tell me what has happened to you. I should
like to hear it. And what is more, I like you."
She said this so carelessly, I did not feel embarrassed.
"Now, then, the whole story, please."
Saying which, she sat down again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really know nothing more of Brande's
Society than you admitted when I last spoke to
you about it?" I asked, without taking the chair
she pushed over to me.</p>

<p>"This is all I know," she answered, in the
rhyming voice of a young pupil declaiming a piece
of a little understood and less cared for recitation.
"The society has very interesting evenings.
Brande shows one beautiful experiments, which,
I daresay, would be amazingly instructive if one
were inclined that way, which I am not. The
men are mostly long-haired creatures with spectacles.
Some of them are rather good-looking.
All are wholly mad. And my friend&mdash;I mean the
only girl I could ever stand as a friend&mdash;Natalie
Brande, is crazy about them."</p>

<p>"Nothing more than that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more."</p>

<p>The clock now struck the hour of nine, the
warning chime for which had startled me.</p>

<p>"Is there anything more than that?" Miss
Metford asked with some impatience.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment. Unless my own senses
had deceived me that evening in Brande's house,
I ran a great risk of sharing George Delany's fate
if I remained where I was much longer. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
suppose I told her all I knew, would not that
bring the same danger upon her too? So I had to
answer:</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. I am a member now."</p>

<p>"Then you must know more than any mere
outsider like myself. I suppose it would not be
fair to ask you. Anyhow, you will come back
and see me soon. By the way, what is your
address?"</p>

<p>I gave her my address. She wrote it down on a
silver-cased tablet, and remarked:</p>

<p>"That will be all right. I'll look you up some
evening."</p>

<p>As I drove to my hotel, I felt that the mesmeric
trick, or whatever artifice had been practised upon
me by Brande and Grey, had now assumed its
true proportion. I laughed at my fears, and was
thankful that I had not described them to the
strong-minded young woman to whose kindly
society I owed so much. What an idiot she would
have thought me!</p>

<p>A servant met me in the hall.</p>

<p>"Telegram, sir. Just arrived at this moment."</p>

<p>I took the telegram, and went upstairs with it
unopened in my hand. A strange fear overcame
me. I dared not open the envelope. I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
beforehand who the sender was, and what the
drift of the message would be. I was right. It
was from Brande.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I beg you to be more cautious. Your discussion
with Miss M. this evening might have been
disastrous. I thought all was over at nine o'clock.</p>
<p class="p4">"<span class="smcap">Brande</span>."</p></div>

<p>I sat down stupefied. When my senses returned,
I looked at the table where I had thrown the telegram.
It was not there, nor in the room. I rang
for the man who had given it to me, and he came
immediately.</p>

<p>"About that telegram you gave me just now,
Phillips&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," the man interrupted,
"I did not give you any telegram this evening."</p>

<p>"I mean when you spoke to me in the hall."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I said 'good-night,' but you took no
notice. Excuse me, sir, I thought you looked
strange."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was thinking of something else. And I
remember now, it was Johnson who gave me the
telegram."</p>

<p>"Johnson left yesterday, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it was yesterday I was thinking of. You
may go, Phillips."</p>

<p>So Brande's telepathic power was objective as
well as subjective. My own brain, unaccustomed
to be impressed by another mind "otherwise than
through the recognised channels of sense," had
supplied the likeliest authority for its message.
The message was duly delivered, but the telegram
was a delusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>GUILTY!</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to protecting Natalie Brande from her brother
and the fanatics with whom he associated, it
was now plain that I was powerless. And what
guarantee had I that she herself was unaware
of his nefarious purpose; that she did not
sympathise with it? This last thought flashed
upon me one day, and the sting of pain that
followed it was so intolerable, I determined instantly
to prove its falsity or truth.</p>

<p>I telegraphed to Brande that I was running
down to spend a day or two with him, and
followed my message without waiting for a reply.
I have still a very distinct recollection of that
journey, notwithstanding much that might well
have blotted it from my memory. Every mile
sped over seemed to mark one more barrier
passed on my way to some strange fate; every
moment which brought me nearer this incomprehensible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
girl with her magical eyes was an
epoch of impossibility against my ever voluntarily
turning back. And now that it is all over, I
am glad that I went on steadfastly to the
end.</p>

<p>Brande received me with the easy affability
of a man to whom good breeding had ceased to
be a habit, and had become an instinct. Only
once did anything pass between us bearing on
the extraordinary relationship which he had
established with me&mdash;the relation of victor and
victim, I considered it. We had been left together
for a few moments, and I said as soon as
the others were out of hearing distance:</p>

<p>"I got your message."</p>

<p>"I know you did," he replied. That was all.
There was an awkward pause. It must be broken
somehow. Any way out of the difficulty was
better than to continue in it.</p>

<p>"Have you seen this?" I asked, handing Brande
a copy of a novel which I had picked up at a
railway bookstall. When I say that it was new
and popular, it will be understood that it was
indecent.</p>

<p>He looked at the title, and said indifferently:
"Yes, I have seen it, and in order to appreciate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this class of fiction fairly, I have even tried to
read it. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I thought it would be in your line.
It is very advanced." I said this to gain time.</p>

<p>"Advanced&mdash;advanced? I am afraid I do not
comprehend. What do you mean by 'advanced'?
And how could it be in my line. I presume you
mean by that, on my plane of thought?"</p>

<p>"By 'advanced,' I mean up-to-date. What
do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"If I used the word at all, I should mean
educated, evolved. Is this evolved? Is it even
educated? It is not always grammatical. It has
no style. In motive, it ante-dates Boccaccio."</p>

<p>"You disapprove of it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Then you approve it, notwithstanding your
immediate condemnation?"</p>

<p>"By no means. I neither approve nor disapprove.
It only represents a phase of humanity&mdash;the
deliberate purpose of securing money
or notoriety to the individual, regardless of the
welfare of the community. There is nothing to
admire in that. It would be invidious to blame
it when the whole social scheme is equally wrong
and contemptible. By the way, what interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
do you think the wares of any literary pander,
of either sex, could possess for me, a student&mdash;even
if a mistaken one&mdash;of science?"</p>

<p>"I did not think the book would possess the
slightest interest for you, and I suppose you are
already aware of that?"</p>

<p>"Ah no! My telepathic power is reserved
for more serious purposes. Its exercise costs me
too much to expend it on trifles. In consequence
I do not know why you mentioned the book."</p>

<p>To this I answered candidly, "I mentioned it
in order to get myself out of a conversational
difficulty&mdash;without much success."</p>

<p>Natalie was reserved with me at first. She
devoted herself unnecessarily to a boy named
Halley who was staying with them. Grey had
gone to London. His place was taken by a Mr.
Rockingham, whom I did not like. There was
something sinister in his expression, and he rarely
spoke save to say something cynical, and in consequence
disagreeable. He had "seen life," that is,
everything deleterious to and destructive of it.
His connection with Brande was clearly a rebound,
the rebound of disgust. There was nothing creditable
to him in that. My first impression of him
was thus unfavourable. My last recollection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
him is a fitting item in the nightmare which
contains it.</p>

<p>The youth Halley would have interested me
under ordinary circumstances. His face was as
handsome and refined as that of a pretty girl.
His figure, too, was slight and his voice effeminate.
But there my own advantage, as I deemed it,
over him ceased. Intellectually, he was a pupil
of Brande's who did his master credit. Having
made this discovery I did not pursue it. My mind
was fixed too fast upon a definite issue to be more
than temporarily interested in the epigrams of
a peachy-cheeked man of science.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced before I had
an opportunity of speaking to Natalie. When
it came, I did not stop to puzzle over a choice
of phrases.</p>

<p>"I wish to speak to you alone on a subject of
extreme importance to me," I said hurriedly.
"Will you come with me to the sea-shore? Your
time, I know, is fully occupied. I would not
ask this if my happiness did not depend
upon it."</p>

<p>The philosopher looked on me with grave, kind
eyes. But the woman's heart within her sent
the red blood flaming to her cheeks. It was then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
given to me to fathom the lowest depth of boorish
stupidity I had ever sounded.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that," I cried, "I would not
dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>The blush on her cheek burnt deeper as she
tossed her head proudly back, and said straight
out, without any show of fence or shadow of
concealment:</p>

<p>"It was my mistake. I am glad to know that
I did you an injustice. You are my friend, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"I believe I have the right to claim that title,"
I answered.</p>

<p>"Then what you ask is granted. Come." She
put her hand boldly into mine. I grasped the
slender fingers, saying:</p>

<p>"Yes, Natalie, some day I will prove to you
that I am your friend."</p>

<p>"The proof is unnecessary," she replied, in a
low sad voice.</p>

<p>We started for the sea. Not a word was spoken
on the way. Nor did our eyes meet. We were
in a strange position. It was this: the man who
had vowed he was the woman's friend&mdash;who did
not intend to shirk the proof of his promise, and
never did gainsay it&mdash;meant to ask the woman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
before the day was over, to clear herself of
knowingly associating with a gang of scientific
murderers. The woman had vaguely divined his
purpose, and could not clear herself.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the shore we occupied
ourselves inconsequently. We hunted little fishes
until Natalie's dainty boots were dripping. We
examined quaint denizens of the shallow water
until her gloves were spoilt. We sprang from
rock to rock and evaded the onrush of the foaming
waves. We made aqueducts for inter-communication
between deep pools. We basked in the
sunshine, and listened to the deep moan of the
sounding sea, and the solemn murmur of the
shells. We drank in the deep breath of the
ocean, and for a brief space we were like happy
children.</p>

<p>The end came soon to this ephemeral happiness.
It was only one of those bright coins snatched
from the niggard hand of Time which must
always be paid back with usurious charges. We
paid with cruel interest.</p>

<p>Standing on a flat rock side by side, I nerved
myself to ask this girl the same question I had
asked her friend, Edith Metford, how much she
knew of the extraordinary and preposterous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Society&mdash;as I still tried to consider it&mdash;which
Herbert Brande had founded. She looked so
frank, so refined, so kind, I hardly dared to put
my brutal question to an innocent girl, whom I
had seen wince at the suffering of a maimed
bird, and pale to the lips at the death-cry of a
rabbit. This time there was no possibility of
untoward consequence in the question save to
myself&mdash;for surely the girl was safe from her own
brother. And I myself preferred to risk the consequences
rather than endure longer the thought
that she belonged voluntarily to a vile murder
club. Yet the question would not come. A
simple thing brought it out. Natalie, after looking
seaward silently for some minutes, said
simply:</p>

<p>"How long are we to stand here, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Until you answer this question. How much
do you know about your brother's Society, which
I have joined to my own intense regret?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry you regret having joined," she
replied gravely.</p>

<p>"You would not be sorry," said I, "if you knew
as much about it as I do," forgetting that I had
still no answer to my question, and that the
extent of her knowledge was unknown to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I do know as much as you." There
was a tremor in her voice and an anxious pleading
look in her eyes. This look maddened me.
Why should she plead to me unless she was guilty?
I stamped my foot upon the rock without noticing
that in so doing I kicked our whole collection
of shells into the water.</p>

<p>There was something more to ask, but I stood
silent and sullen. The woods above the beach
were choral with bird-voices. They were hateful
to me. The sea song of the tumbling waves was
hideous. I cursed the yellow sunset light glaring
on their snowy crests. A tiny hand was laid
upon my arm. I writhed under its deadly if
delicious touch. But I could not put it away, nor
keep from turning to the sweet face beside me,
to mark once more its mute appeal&mdash;now more
than mere appeal; it was supplication that was in
her eyes. Her red lips were parted as though
they voiced an unspoken prayer. At last a prayer
did pass from them to me.</p>

<p>"Do not judge me until you know me better.
Do not hate me without cause. I am not wicked,
as you think. I&mdash;I&mdash;I am trying to do what I
think is right. At least, I am not selfish or cruel.
Trust me yet a little while."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at her one moment, and then with a
sob I clasped her in my arms, and cried aloud:</p>

<p>"My God! to name murder and that angel face
in one breath! Child, you have been befooled.
You know nothing."</p>

<p>For a second she lingered in my embrace. Then
she gently put away my arms, and looking up at
me, said fearlessly but sorrowfully:</p>

<p>"I cannot lie&mdash;even for your love. I know <i>all</i>."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>THE WOKING MYSTERY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> knew all. Then she was a murderess&mdash;or in
sympathy with murderers. My arms fell from
her. I drew back shuddering. I dared not look
in her lying eyes, which cried pity when her base
heart knew no mercy. Surely now I had solved
the maddening puzzle which the character of this
girl had, so far, presented to me. Yet the true
solution was as far from me as ever. Indeed, I
could not well have been further from it than at
that moment.</p>

<p>As we walked back, Natalie made two or three
unsuccessful attempts to lure me out of the silence
which was certainly more eloquent on my part
than any words I could have used. Once she
commenced:</p>

<p>"It is hard to explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>I interrupted her harshly. "No explanation is
possible."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>On that she put her handkerchief to her eyes,
and a half-suppressed sob shook her slight figure.
Her grief distracted me. But what could I say to
assuage it?</p>

<p>At the hall door I stopped and said, "Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Are you not coming in?"</p>

<p>There was a directness and emphasis in the
question which did not escape me.</p>

<p>"I?" The horror in my own voice surprised
myself, and assuredly did not pass without her
notice.</p>

<p>"Very well; good-bye. We are not exactly
slaves of convention here, but you are too far
advanced in that direction even for me. This is
your second startling departure from us. I trust
you will spare me the humiliation entailed by the
condescension of your further acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Give me an hour!" I exclaimed aghast. "You
do not make allowance for the enigma in which
everything is wrapped up. I said I was your
friend when I thought you of good report. Give
me an hour&mdash;only an hour&mdash;to say whether I will
stand by my promise, now that you yourself have
claimed that your report is not good but evil. For
that is really what you have protested. Do I ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
too much? or is your generosity more limited even
than my own?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no! I would not have you think that.
Take an hour, or a year&mdash;an hour only if you
care for my happiness."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said I. "I will take the hour. Discretion
can have the year."</p>

<p>So I left her. I could not go indoors. A roof
would smother me. Give me the open lawns, the
leafy woods, the breath of the summer wind.
Away, then, to the silence of the coming night.
For an hour leave me to my thoughts. Her unworthiness
was now more than suspected. It was
admitted. My misery was complete. But I would
not part with her; I could not. Innocent or guilty,
she was mine. I must suffer with her or for her.
The resolution by which I have abided was formed
as I wandered lonely through the woods.</p>

<p>When I reached my room that night I found a
note from Brande. To receive a letter from a
man in whose house I was a guest did not surprise
me. I was past that stage. There was nothing
mysterious in the letter, save its conclusion. It
was simply an invitation to a public meeting of
the Society, which was to be held on that day
week in the hall in Hanover Square, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
special feature in the letter&mdash;seeing that it did
not vanish like the telegram, but remained an
ordinary sheet of paper&mdash;lay in its concluding
sentence. This urged me to allow nothing to
prevent my attendance. "You will perhaps understand
thereafter that we are neither political
plotters nor lunatics, as you have thought."</p>

<p>Thought! The man's mysterious power was
becoming wearisome. It was too much for me.
I wished that I had never seen his face.</p>

<p>As I lay sleepless in my bed, I recommenced
that interminable introspection which, heretofore,
had been so barren of result. It was easy to
swear to myself that I would stand by Natalie
Brande, that I would never desert her. But how
should my action be directed in order that by its
conduct I might prevail upon the girl herself to
surrender her evil associates? I knew that she
regarded me with affection. And I knew also that
she would not leave her brother for my sake. Did
she sympathise with his nefarious schemes, or
was she decoyed into them like myself?</p>

<p>Decoyed! That was it!</p>

<p>I sprang from the bed, beside myself with
delight. Now I had not merely a loophole of
escape from all these miseries; I had a royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
highway. Fool, idiot, blind mole that I was,
not to perceive sooner that easy solution of the
problem! No wonder that she was wounded by
my unworthy doubts. And she had tried to explain,
but I would not listen! I threw myself
back and commenced to weave all manner of pleasant
fancies round the salvation of this girl from
her brother's baneful influence, and the annihilation
of his Society, despite its occult powers, by
mine own valour. The reaction was too great.
Instead of constructing marvellous counterplots, I
fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>Next day I found Natalie in a pleasant morning-room
to which I was directed. She wore her
most extreme&mdash;and, in consequence, most exasperating&mdash;rational
costume. When I entered the
room she pushed a chair towards me, in a way
that suggested Miss Metford's worst manner, and
lit a cigarette, for the express purpose, I felt, of
annoying me.</p>

<p>"I have come," I said somewhat shamefacedly,
"to explain."</p>

<p>"And apologise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to apologise. I made a hideous mistake.
I have suffered for it as much as you
could wish."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wish you to suffer!" She flung away her
cigarette. Her dark eyes opened wide in unassumed
surprise. And that curious light of
pity, which I had so often wondered at, came into
them. "I am very sorry if you have suffered,"
she said, with convincing earnestness.</p>

<p>"How could I doubt you? Senseless fool that
I was to suppose for one moment that you approved
of what you could not choose but know&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this her face clouded.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are still in error. What
opinion have you formed which alters your estimate
of me?"</p>

<p>"The only opinion possible: that you have
unwillingly learned the secret of your brother's
Society; but, like myself&mdash;you see no way to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what purpose?"</p>

<p>"To destroy it."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to attempt that."</p>

<p>"No, it would be impossible, and the effort
would cost your life."</p>

<p>"That is not my reason." She arose and stood
facing me. "I do not like to lose your esteem.
You know already that I will not lie to retain it.
I approve of the Society's purpose."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"And its actions?"</p>

<p>"They are inevitable. Therefore I approve
also of its actions. I shall not ask you to remain
now, for I see that you are again horrified; as is
natural, considering your knowledge&mdash;or, pardon
me for saying so, your want of knowledge. I
shall be glad to see you after the lecture to
which you are invited. You will know a little
more then; not all, perhaps, but enough to
shake your time-dishonoured theories of life&mdash;and
death."</p>

<p>I bowed, and left the room without a word.
It was true, then, that she was mad like the
others, or worse than mad&mdash;a thousand times
worse! I said farewell to Brande, as his guest,
for the last time. Thenceforward I would meet
him as his enemy&mdash;his secret enemy as far as I
could preserve my secrecy with such a man; his
open enemy when the proper time should come.</p>

<p>In the railway carriage I turned over some
letters and papers which I found in my pockets,
not with deliberate intention, but to while away
the time. One scrap startled me. It was the
sheet on which Brande had written the Woking
address, and on reading it over once more, a
thought occurred to me which I acted on as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as possible. I could go to Woking and find out
something about the man Delany. So long as
my inquiries were kept within the limits of
the strictest discretion, neither Brande nor
any of his executive could blame me for seeking
convincing evidence of the secret power
they claimed.</p>

<p>On my arrival in London, I drove immediately
to the London Necropolis Company's station and
caught the funeral train which runs to Brookwood
cemetery. With Saint Anne's Chapel as
my base, I made short excursions hither and
thither, and stood before a tombstone erected
to the memory of George Delany, late of the
Criminal Investigation Department, Scotland
Yard. This was a clue which I could follow,
so I hurried back to town and called on the
superintendent of the department.</p>

<p>Yes, I was told, Delany had belonged to the
department. He had been a very successful
officer in ferreting out foreign Anarchists and
evil-doers. His last movement was to join a
Society of harmless cranks who met in Hanover
Square. No importance was attached to this in
the department. It could not have been done in
the way of business, although Delany pretended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that it was. He had dropped dead in the street
as he was leaving his cab to enter the office with
information which must have appeared to him
important&mdash;to judge from the cabman's evidence
as to his intense excitement and repeated directions
for faster driving. There was an inquest
and a post-mortem, but "death from natural
causes" was the verdict. That was all. It was
enough for me.</p>

<p>I had now sufficient evidence, and was finally
convinced that the Society was as dangerous as
it was demented.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>CUI BONO?</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I arrived at the Society's rooms on the evening
for which I had an invitation, I found them
pleasantly lighted. The various scientific diagrams
and instruments had been removed, and comfortable
arm-chairs were arranged so that a free
passage was available, not merely to each row, but
to each chair. The place was full when I entered,
and soon afterwards the door was closed and locked.
Natalie Brande and Edith Metford were seated beside
each other. An empty chair was on Miss
Metford's right. She saw me standing at the door
and nodded toward the empty seat which she had
reserved for me. When I reached it she made a
movement as if to forestall me and leave me the
middle chair. I deprecated this by a look which
was intentionally so severe that she described it
later as a malignant scowl.</p>

<p>I could not at the moment seat myself voluntarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
beside Natalie Brande with the exact and
final knowledge which I had learnt at Scotland
Yard only one week old. I could not do it just
then, although I did not mean to draw back from
what I had undertaken&mdash;to stand by her, innocent
or guilty. But I must have time to become accustomed
to the sensation which followed this
knowledge. Miss Metford's fugitive attempts at
conversation pending the commencement of the
lecture were disagreeable to me.</p>

<p>There was a little stir on the platform. The
chairman, in a few words, announced Herbert
Brande. "This is the first public lecture," he said,
"which has been given since the formation of the
Society, and in consequence of the fact that a
number of people not scientifically educated are
present, the lecturer will avoid the more esoteric
phases of his subject, which would otherwise present
themselves in his treatment of it, and confine
himself to the commonplaces of scientific insight.
The title of the lecture is identical with that of our
Society&mdash;<i>Cui Bono?</i>"</p>

<p>Brande came forward unostentatiously and
placed a roll of paper on the reading-desk. I have
copied the extracts which follow from this manuscript.
The whole essay, indeed, remains with me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
intact, but it is too long&mdash;and it would be immaterial&mdash;to
reproduce it all in this narrative. I
cannot hope either to reproduce the weird impressiveness
of the lecturer's personality, his hold over
his audience, or my own emotions in listening to
this man&mdash;whom I had proved, not only from his
own confession, but by the strongest collateral
evidence, to be a callous and relentless murderer&mdash;to
hear him glide with sonorous voice and graceful
gesture from point to point in his logical and
terrible indictment of suffering!&mdash;the futility of it,
both in itself and that by which it was administered!
No one could know Brande without
finding interest, if not pleasure, in his many chance
expressions full of curious and mysterious thought.
I had often listened to his extemporaneous brain
pictures, as the reader knows, but I had never
before heard him deliberately formulate a planned-out
system of thought. And such a system! This
is the gospel according to Brande.</p>

<p>"In the verbiage of primitive optimism a misleading
limitation is placed on the significance of
the word Nature and its inflections. And the misconception
of the meaning of an important word is
as certain to lead to an inaccurate concept as is the
misstatement of a premise to precede a false conclusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
For instance, in the aphorism, variously
rendered, 'what is natural is right,' there is an
excellent illustration of the misapplication of the
word 'natural.' If the saying means that what is
natural is just and wise, it might as well run
'what is natural is wrong,' injustice and unwisdom
being as natural, <i>i.e.</i>, a part of Nature, as justice
and wisdom. Morbidity and immorality are as
natural as health and purity. Not more so, but
not less so. That 'Nature is made better by no
mean but Nature makes that mean,' is true enough.
It is inevitably true. The question remains, in
making that mean, has she really made anything
that tends toward the final achievement of
universal happiness? I say she has not.</p>

<p>"The misuse of a word, it may be argued, could
not prove a serious obstacle to the growth of
knowledge, and might be even interesting to the
student of etymology. But behind the misuse of
the word 'natural' there is a serious confusion of
thought which must be clarified before the mass of
human intelligence can arrive at a just appreciation
of the verities which surround human existence,
and explain it. To this end it is necessary
to get rid of the archaic idea of Nature as a
paternal, providential, and beneficent protector, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
successor to the 'special providence,' and to know
the true Nature, bond-slave as she is of her own
eternal persistence of force; that sole primary
principle of which all other principles are only
correlatives; of which the existence of matter is
but a cognisable evidence.</p>

<p>"The optimist notion, therefore, that Nature is an
all-wise designer, in whose work order, system,
wisdom, and beauty are prominent, does not fare
well when placed under the microscope of scientific
research.</p>

<p>"Order?</p>

<p>"There is no order in Nature. Her armies are
but seething mobs of rioters, destroying everything
they can lay hands on.</p>

<p>"System?</p>

<p>"She has no system, unless it be a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>, which only blunders on the right way
after fruitlessly trying every other conceivable
path. She is not wise. She never fills a pail but
she spills a hogshead. All her works are not
beautiful. She never makes a masterpiece but she
smashes a million 'wasters' without a care. The
theory of evolution&mdash;her gospel&mdash;reeks with
ruffianism, nature-patented and promoted. The
whole scheme of the universe, all material existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
as it is popularly known, is founded upon and
begotten of a system of everlasting suffering as
hideous as the fantastic nightmares of religious
maniacs. The Spanish Inquisitors have been regarded
as the most unnatural monsters who ever
disgraced the history of mankind. Yet the atrocities
of the Inquisitors, like the battlefields of
Napoleon and other heroes, were not only natural,
but they have their prototypes in every cubic
inch of stagnant water, or ounce of diseased tissue.
And stagnant water is as natural as sterilised
water; and diseased tissue is as natural as healthy
tissue. Wholesale murder is Nature's first law.
She creates only to kill, and applies the rule as
remorselessly to the units in a star-drift as to the
tadpoles in a horse-pond.</p>

<p>"It seems a far cry from a star-drift to a horse-pond.
It is so in distance and magnitude. It is
not in the matter of constituents. In ultimate
composition they are identical. The great nebula
in Andromeda is an aggregation of atoms, and so
is the river Thames. The only difference between
them is the difference in the arrangement and
incidence of these atoms and in the molecular
motion of which they are the first but not the final
cause. In a pint of Thames water, we know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
there is bound up a latent force beside which
steam and electricity are powerless in comparison.
To release that force it is only necessary to apply
the sympathetic key; just as the heated point of
a needle will explode a mine of gunpowder and lay
a city in ashes. That force is asleep. The atoms
which could give it reality are at rest, or, at least,
in a condition of <i>quasi</i>-rest. But in the stupendous
mass of incandescent gas which constitutes the
nebula of Andromeda, every atom is madly seeking
rest and finding none; whirling in raging haste,
battling with every other atom in its field of
motion, impinging upon others and influencing
them, being impinged upon and influenced by
them. That awful cauldron exemplifies admirably
the method of progress stimulated by suffering. It
is the embryo of a new Sun and his planets.
After many million years of molecular agony, when
his season of fission had come, he will rend huge
fragments from his mass and hurl them helpless
into space, there to grow into his satellites. In
their turn they may reproduce themselves in like
manner before their true planetary life begins, in
which they shall revolve around their parent as
solid spheres. Follow them further and learn how
beneficent Nature deals with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"After the lapse of time-periods which man
may calculate in figures, but of which his finite
mind cannot form even a true symbolic conception,
the outer skin of the planet cools&mdash;rests.
Internal troubles prevail for longer periods still;
and these, in their unsupportable agony, bend
and burst the solid strata overlying; vomit fire
through their self-made blow-holes, rear mountains
from the depths of the sea, then dash them
in pieces.</p>

<p>"Time strides on austere.</p>

<p>"The globe still cools. Life appears upon it.
Then begins anew the old strife, but under conditions
far more dreadful, for though it be founded
on atomic consciousness, the central consciousness
of the heterogeneous aggregation of atoms becomes
immeasurably more sentient and susceptible with
every step it takes from homogenesis. This
internecine war must continue while any creature
great or small shall remain alive upon the world
that bore it.</p>

<p>"By slow degrees the mighty milestones in the
protoplasmic march are passed. Plants and animals
are now busy, murdering and devouring
each other&mdash;the strong everywhere destroying
the weak. New types appear. Old types disappear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Types possessing the greatest capacity
for murder progress most rapidly, and those
with the least recede and determine. The neolithic
man succeeds the pal&aelig;olithic man, and
sharpens the stone axe. Then to increase their
power for destruction, men find it better to hunt
in packs. Communities appear. Soon each community
discovers that its own advantage is
furthered by confining its killing, in the main,
to the members of neighbouring communities.
Nations early make the same discovery. And at
last, as with ourselves, there is established a race
with conscience enough to know that it is vile,
and intelligence enough to know that it is insignificant.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
But what profits this? In the
fulness of its time the race shall die. Man will
go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will
perish. The uneasy consciousness which, in
this obscure corner, has for a brief space broken
the silence of the Universe, will be at rest. Matter
will know itself no longer. Life and death and
love, stronger than death, will be as though they
never had been. Nor will anything that <i>is</i> be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
better or be worse for all that the labour, genius,
devotion, and suffering of man have striven
through countless generations to effect.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> From this sentence to the end of the paragraph Brande
draws freely, for the purpose of his own argument, on Mr.
Balfour's "Naturalism and Ethics."&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p></div>

<p>"The roaring loom of Time weaves on. The
globe cools out. Life mercifully ceases from upon
its surface. The atmosphere and water disappear.
It rests. It is dead.</p>

<p>"But for its vicarious service in influencing
more youthful planets within its reach, that dead
world might as well be loosed at once from its
gravitation cable and be turned adrift into space.
Its time has not yet come. It will not come
until the great central sun of the system to which
it belongs has passed laboriously through all
his stages of stellar life and died out also. Then
when that dead sun, according to the impact
theory, blunders across the path of another sun,
dead and blind like himself, its time will come.
The result of that impact will be a new star
nebula, with all its weary history before it; a
history of suffering, in which a million years
will not be long enough to write a single page.</p>

<p>"Here we have a scientific parallel to the hell
of superstition which may account for the instinctive
origin of the smoking flax and the
fire which shall never be quenched. We know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that the atoms of which the human body is built
up are atoms of matter. It follows that every
atom in every living body will be present in
some form at that final impact in which the solar
system will be ended in a blazing whirlwind which
will melt the earth with its fervent heat. There
is not a molecule or cell in any creature alive this
day which will not in its ultimate constituents
endure the long agony, lasting countless &aelig;ons of
centuries, wherein the solid mass of this great
globe will be represented by a rush of incandescent
gas, stupendous in itself, but trivial in comparison
with the hurricane of flame in which it
will be swallowed up and lost.</p>

<p>"And when from that hell a new star emerges,
and new planets in their season are born of him,
and he and they repeat, as they must repeat, the
ceaseless, changeless, remorseless story of the
universe, every atom in this earth will take its
place, and fill again functions identical with those
which it, or its fellow, fills now. Life will
reappear, develop, determine, to be renewed again
as before. And so on for ever.</p>

<p>"Nature has known no rest. From the beginning&mdash;which
never was&mdash;she has been building
up only to tear down again. She has been fabricating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
pretty toys and trinkets, that cost her many
a thousand years to forge, only to break them in
pieces for her sport. With infinite painstaking
she has manufactured man only to torture him
with mean miseries in the embryonic stages of his
race, and in his higher development to madden
him with intellectual puzzles. Thus it will be
unto the end&mdash;which never shall be. For there is
neither beginning nor end to her unvarying cycles.
Whether the secular optimist be successful or unsuccessful
in realising his paltry span of terrestrial
paradise, whether the p&aelig;ans he sings about it are
prophetic dithyrambs or misleading myths, no
Christian man need fear for his own immortality.
That is well assured. In some form he will surely
be raised from the dead. In some shape he will
live again. But, <i>Cui bono</i>?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>FORCE&mdash;A REMEDY.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Get</span> me out of this, I am stifled&mdash;ill," Miss
Metford said, in a low voice to me.</p>

<p>As we were hurrying from the room, Brande
and his sister, who had joined him, met us.
The fire had died out of his eyes. His voice
had returned to its ordinary key. His demeanour
was imperturbable, sphinx-like. I murmured some
words about the eloquence of the lecture, but
interrupted myself when I observed his complete
indifference to my remarks, and said,</p>

<p>"Neither praise nor blame seems to affect you,
Brande."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he answered calmly. "You
forget that there is nothing deserving of either
praise or blame."</p>

<p>I knew I could not argue with him, so we
passed on. Outside, I offered to find a cab for
Miss Metford, and to my surprise she allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
me to do so. Her self-assertive manner was
visibly modified. She made no pretence of resenting
this slight attention, as was usual with
her in similar cases. Indeed, she asked me to
accompany her as far as our ways lay together.
But I felt that my society at the time could
hardly prove enlivening. I excused myself by
saying candidly that I wished to be alone.</p>

<p>My own company soon became unendurable.
In despair I turned into a music hall. The
contrast between my mental excitement and the
inanities of the stage was too acute, so this
resource speedily failed me. Then I betook
myself to the streets again. Here I remembered
a letter Brande had put into my hand
as I left the hall. It was short, and the tone
was even more peremptory than his usual
arrogance. It directed me to meet the members
of the Society at Charing Cross station at two
o'clock on the following day. No information
was given, save that we were all going on a
long journey; that I must set my affairs in
such order that my absence would not cause
any trouble, and the letter ended, "Our experiments
are now complete. Our plans are
matured. Do not fail to attend."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fail to attend!" I muttered. "If I am
not the most abject coward on the earth I
will attend&mdash;with every available policeman in
London." The pent-up wrath and impotence
of many days found voice at last. "Yes,
Brande," I shouted aloud, "I will attend, and
you shall be sorry for having invited me."</p>

<p>"But I will not be sorry," said Natalie
Brande, touching my arm.</p>

<p>"You here!" I exclaimed, in great surprise,
for it was fully an hour since I left the hall,
and my movements had been at haphazard
since then.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have followed you for your own
sake. Are you really going to draw back now?"</p>

<p>"I must."</p>

<p>"Then I must go on alone."</p>

<p>"You will not go on alone. You will remain,
and your friends shall go on without you&mdash;go
to prison without you, I mean."</p>

<p>"Poor boy," she said softly, to herself. "I
wonder if I would have thought as I think
now if I had known him sooner? I suppose
I should have been as other women, and their
fools' paradise would have been mine&mdash;for a
little while."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The absolute hopelessness in her voice pierced
my heart. I pleaded passionately with her to
give up her brother and all the maniacs who
followed him. For the time I forgot utterly
that the girl, by her own confession, was
already with them in sympathy as well as in
deed.</p>

<p>She said to me: "I cannot hold back now.
And you? You know you are powerless to
interfere. If you will not come with me, I
must go alone. But you may remain. I have
prevailed on Herbert and Grey to permit that."</p>

<p>"Never," I answered. "Where you go, I go."</p>

<p>"It is not really necessary. In the end it will
make no difference. And remember, you still
think me guilty."</p>

<p>"Even so, I am going with you&mdash;guilty."</p>

<p>Now this seemed to me a very ordinary speech,
for who would have held back, thinking her innocent?
But Natalie stopped suddenly, and, looking
me in the face, said, almost with a sob:</p>

<p>"Arthur, I sometimes wish I had known you
sooner. I might have been different." She was
silent for a moment. Then she said piteously to
me: "You will not fail me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not fail you to-morrow," I answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>She pressed my hand gratefully, and left me
without any explanation as to her movements in
the meantime.</p>

<p>I hurried to my hotel to set my affairs in order
before joining Brande's expedition. The time was
short for this. Fortunately there was not much
to do. By midnight I had my arrangements
nearly complete. At the time, the greater part of
my money was lying at call in a London bank.
This I determined to draw in gold the next day.
I also had at my banker's some scrip, and I knew
I could raise money on that. My personal effects
and the mementos of my travels, which lay about
my rooms in great confusion, must remain where
they were. As to the few friends who still remained
to me, I did not write to them. I could
not well describe a project of which I knew
nothing, save that it was being carried out
by dangerous lunatics, or, at least, by men who
were dangerous, whether their madness was real
or assumed. Nor could I think of any reasonable
excuse for leaving England after so long an
absence without a personal visit to them. It was
best, then, to disappear without a word. Having
finished my dispositions, I changed my coat for a
dressing-gown and sat down by the window, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I threw open, for the summer night was warm. I
sat long, and did not leave my chair until the
morning sun was shining on my face.</p>

<p>When I got to Charing Cross next day, a group
of fifty or sixty people were standing apart from
the general crowd and conversing with animation.
Almost the whole strength of the Society was
assembled to see a few of us off, I thought. In
fact, they were all going. About a dozen women
were in the party, and they were dressed in the
most extravagant rational costumes. Edith Metford
was amongst them. I drew her aside, and
apologised for not having called to wish her farewell;
but she stopped me.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right; I am going too. Don't look
so frightened."</p>

<p>This was more than I could tolerate. She was
far too good a girl to be allowed to walk blindfold
into the pit I had digged for myself with full
knowledge. I said imperatively:</p>

<p>"Miss Metford, you shall not go. I warned you
more than once&mdash;and warned you, I firmly believe,
at the risk of my life&mdash;against these people. You
have disregarded the advice which it may yet
cost me dear to have given you."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," she said candidly, "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
would not go an inch if it were not for yourself.
I can't trust you with them. You'd get into mischief.
I don't mean with Natalie Brande, but the
others; I don't like them. So I am coming to
look after you."</p>

<p>"Then I shall speak to Brande."</p>

<p>"That would be useless. I joined the Society
this morning."</p>

<p>This she said seriously, and without anything
of the spirit of bravado which was one of her
faults. That ended our dispute. We exchanged a
meaning look as our party took their seats. There
was now, at any rate, one human being in the
Society to whom I could speak my mind.</p>

<p>We travelled by special train. Our ultimate
destination was a fishing village on the southern
coast, near Brande's residence. Here we found a
steam yacht of about a thousand tons lying in the
harbour with steam up.</p>

<p>The vessel was a beautiful model. Her lines
promised great speed, but the comfort of her passengers
had been no less considered by her builder
when he gave her so much beam and so high
a freeboard. The ship's furniture was the finest
I had ever seen, and I had crossed every great
ocean in the world. The library, especially, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
more suggestive of a room in the British Museum
than the batch of books usually carried at sea.
But I have no mind to enter on a detailed description
of a beautiful pleasure ship while my
story waits. I only mention the general condition
of the vessel in evidence of the fact which
now struck me for the first time&mdash;Brande must
have unlimited money. His mode of life in
London and in the country, notwithstanding his
pleasant house, was in the simplest style. From
the moment we entered his special train at
Charing Cross, he flung money about him with
wanton recklessness.</p>

<p>As we made our way through the crowd which
was hanging about the quay, an unpleasant incident
occurred. Miss Brande, with Halley and
Rockingham, became separated from Miss Metford
and myself and went on in front of us. We
five had formed a sub-section of the main body,
and were keeping to ourselves when the unavoidable
separation took place. A slight scream in
front caused Miss Metford and myself to hurry
forward. We found the others surrounded by a
gang of drunken sailors, who had stopped them.
A red-bearded giant, frenzied with drink, had
seized Natalie in his arms. His abettor, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
swarthy Italian, had drawn his knife, and menaced
Halley and Rockingham. The rest of the
band looked on, and cheered their chiefs. Halley
was white to the lips; Rockingham was perfectly
calm, or, perhaps, indifferent. He called for a
policeman. Neither interfered. I did not blame
Rockingham; he was a man of the world, so
nothing manly could be expected of him. But
Halley's cowardice disgusted me.</p>

<p>I rushed forward and caught the Italian from
behind, for his knife was dangerous. Seizing
him by the collar and waist, I swung him twice,
and then flung him from me with all my strength.
He spun round two or three times, and then
collided with a stack of timber. His head struck
a beam, and he fell in his tracks without a word.
The red-haired giant instantly released Natalie
and put up his hands. The man's attitude
showed that he knew nothing of defence. I
swept his guard aside, and struck him violently
on the neck close to the ear. I was a trained
boxer; but I had never before struck a blow in
earnest, or in such earnest, and I hardly knew
my own strength. The man went down with a
grunt like a pole-axed ox, and lay where he fell.
To a drunken sailor lad, who seemed anxious to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
be included in this matter, I dealt a stinging
smack on the face with my open hand that satisfied
him straightway. The others did not molest
me. Turning from the crowd, I found Edith
Metford looking at me with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>"Superb! Marcel, I am proud of you!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"Oh! Edith, how can you say that?" Natalie
Brande exclaimed, still trembling. "Such dreadful
violence! The poor men knew no better."</p>

<p>"Poor fiddlesticks! It is well for you that
Marcel is a man of violence. He's worth a dozen
sheep like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like whom, Miss Metford?" Rockingham
asked, glaring at her so viciously that I interposed
with a hasty entreaty that all should
hurry to the ship. I did not trust the man.</p>

<p>Miss Metford was not so easily suppressed.
She said leisurely, "I meant to say like you, and
this over-nervous but otherwise admirable boy.
If you think 'sheep' derogatory, pray make it
'goats.'"</p>

<p>I hurried them on board. Brande welcomed
us at the gangway. The vessel was his own, so
he was as much at home on the ship as in his
country house. I had an important letter to write,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and very little time for the task. It was not
finished a moment too soon, for the moment the
last passenger and the last bale of luggage was
on board, the captain's telegraph rang from the
bridge, and the <i>Esmeralda</i> steamed out to sea.
My letter, however, was safe on shore. The land
was low down upon the horizon before the long
summer twilight deepened slowly into night.
Then one by one the shadowy cliffs grew dim,
dark, and disappeared. We saw no more of
England until after many days of gradually culminating
horror. The very night which was our
first at sea did not pass without a strange adventure,
which happened, indeed, by an innocent
oversight.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>MORITURI TE SALUTANT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had been sitting on deck chairs smoking
and talking for a couple of hours after the late
dinner, which was served as soon as the vessel
was well out to sea, when Brande came on
deck. He was hailed with enthusiasm. This
did not move him, or even interest him. I was
careful not to join in the acclamations produced
by his presence. He noticed this, and lightly
called me recalcitrant. I admitted the justice
of the epithet, and begged him to consider it
one which would always apply to me with
equal force. He laughed at this, and contrasted
my gloomy fears with the excellent arrangements
which he had made for my comfort. I
asked him what had become of Grey. I thought
it strange that this man should be amongst
the absentees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Grey! He goes to Labrador."</p>

<p>"To Labrador! What takes him to Labrador?"</p>

<p>"The same purpose which takes us to the
Arafura Sea," Brande answered, and passed on.</p>

<p>Presently there was a slight stir amongst the
people, and the word was passed round that
Brande was about to undertake some interesting
experiment for the amusement of his guests.
I hurried aft along with some other men with
whom I had been talking, and found Miss
Brande and Miss Metford standing hand in hand.
Natalie's face was very white, and the only time
I ever saw real fear upon it was at that
moment. I thought the incident on the quay
had unnerved her more than was apparent at
the time, and that she was still upset by it.
She beckoned to me, and when I came to her
she seized my hand. She was trembling so much
her words were hardly articulate. Miss Metford
was concerned for her companion's nervousness;
but otherwise indifferent; while Natalie stood
holding our hands in hers like a frightened
child awaiting the firing of a cannon.</p>

<p>"He's going to let off something, a rocket,
I suppose," Miss Metford said to me. "Natalie
seems to think he means to sink the ship."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"He does not mean to do so. He might, if
an accident occurred."</p>

<p>"Is he going to fire a mine?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, he is going to etherize a drop of water."
Natalie said this so seriously, we had no thought
of laughter, incongruous as the cause of her
fears might seem.</p>

<p>At that moment Brande addressed us from
the top of the deckhouse, and explained that,
in order to illustrate on a large scale the most
recent discovery in natural science, he was about
to disintegrate a drop of water, at present encased
in a hollow glass ball about the size of a pea,
which he held between his thumb and forefinger.
An electric light was turned upon him
so that we could all see the thing quite plainly.
He explained that there was a division in the
ball; one portion of it containing the drop of
water, and the other the agent by which, when
the dividing wall was eaten through by its
action, the atoms of the water would be resolved
into the ultimate ether of which they
were composed. As the disintegrating agent was
powerless in salt water, we might all feel assured
that no great catastrophe would ensue.</p>

<p>Before throwing the glass ball overboard, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
careful search for the lights of ships was made
from east to west, and north to south.</p>

<p>There was not a light to be seen anywhere.
Brande threw the ball over the side. We were
going under easy steam at the time, but the
moment he left the deckhouse "full speed ahead"
was rung from the bridge, and the <i>Esmeralda</i>
showed us her pace. She literally tore through
the water when the engines were got full on.</p>

<p>Before we had gone a hundred yards a great
cry arose. A little fleet of French fishing-boats
with no lights up had been lying very close to
us on the starboard bow. There they were,
boatfuls of men, who waved careless adieus to
us as we dashed past.</p>

<p>Brande was moved for a moment. Then he
shrugged his shoulders and muttered, "It can't be
helped now." We all felt that these simple words
might mean much. To test their full portent I
went over to him, Natalie still holding my hand
with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"Can't you do anything for them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You mean, go back and sink this ship to keep
them company?"</p>

<p>"No; but warn them to fly."</p>

<p>"It would be useless. In this breeze they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not sail a hundred yards in the time allowed, and
three miles is the nearest point of safety. I could
not say definitely, as this is the first time I have
ever tried an experiment so tremendous; but I
believe that if we even slowed to half speed, it
would be dangerous, and if we stopped, the
<i>Esmeralda</i> would go to the bottom to-night, as
certainly as the sun will rise to-morrow."</p>

<p>Natalie moaned in anguish on hearing this. I
said to her sternly:</p>

<p>"I thought you approved of all these actions?"</p>

<p>"This serves no purpose. These men may not
even have a painless death, and the reality is more
awful than I thought."</p>

<p>Every face was turned to that point in the darkness
toward which the foaming wake of the
<i>Esmeralda</i> stretched back. Not a word more was
spoken until Brande, who was standing, watch in
hand, beside the light from the deckhouse, came
aft and said:</p>

<p>"You will see the explosion in ten seconds."</p>

<p>He could not have spoken more indifferently if
the catastrophe he had planned was only the firing
of a penny squib.</p>

<p>Then the sea behind us burst into a flame,
followed by the sound of an explosion so frightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
that we were almost stunned by it. A huge mass
of water, torn up in a solid block, was hurled into
the air, and there it broke into a hundred roaring
cataracts. These, in the brilliant search light from
the ship which was now turned upon them full, fell
like cataracts of liquid silver into the seething
cauldron of water that raged below. The instant
the explosion was over, our engines were reversed,
and the <i>Esmeralda</i> went full speed astern. The
waves were still rolling in tumultuous breakers
when we got back. We might as well have gone
on.</p>

<p>The French fishing fleet had disappeared.</p>

<p>I could not help saying to Brande before we
turned in:</p>

<p>"You expect us, I suppose, to believe that the
explosion was really caused by a drop of water?"</p>

<p>"Etherized," he interrupted. "Certainly I do.
You don't believe it&mdash;on what grounds?"</p>

<p>"That it is unbelievable."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! You deny a fact because you do not
understand it. Ignorance is not evidence."</p>

<p>"I say it is impossible."</p>

<p>"You do not wish to believe it possible. Wishes
are not proofs."</p>

<p>Without pursuing the argument, I said to him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is fortunate that the accident took place at
sea. There will be no inquests."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am sorry for the accident. As for the
men, they might have had a worse fate. It is
better than living in life-long misery as they do.
Besides, both they and the fishes that will eat
them will soon be numbered amongst the things
that have been."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>"NO DEATH&mdash;SAVE IN LIFE."</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some days afterwards our voyage was uneventful,
and the usual shipboard amusements
were requisitioned to while away the tedious
hours. The French fishing fleet was never mentioned.
We got through the Bay with very little
knocking about, and passed the Rock without
calling. I was not disappointed, for there was
slight inducement for going ashore, oppressed as I
was with the ever-present incubus of dread. At
intervals this feeling became less acute, but only
to return, strengthened by its short absences.
After a time my danger sense became blunted.
The nervous system became torpid under continuous
stress, and refused to pass on the sensations
with sufficient intensity to the brain; or the
weary brain was asleep at its post and did not
heed the warnings. I could think no more.</p>

<p>And this reminds me of something which I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
tell about young Halley. For several days after
the voyage began, the boy avoided me. I knew
his reason for doing this. I myself did not blame
him for his want of physical courage, but I was
glad that he himself was ashamed of it.</p>

<p>Halley came to me one morning and said:</p>

<p>"I wish to speak to you, Marcel. I <i>must</i>
speak to you. It is about that miserable episode
on the evening we left England. I acted like a
cad. Therefore I must be a cad. I only want to
tell you that I despise myself as much as you can.
And that I envy you. I never thought that I
should envy a man simply because he had no
nervous system."</p>

<p>"Who is this man without a nervous system of
whom you speak?" I asked coldly. I was not
sorry that I had an opportunity of reading him a
lesson which might be placed opposite the many
indignities which had been put upon me, in the
form mainly of shoulder shrugs, brow elevations,
and the like.</p>

<p>"You, of course. I mean no offence&mdash;you are
magnificent. I am honest in saying that I admire
you. I wish I was like you in height, weight,
muscle&mdash;and absence of nervous system."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would keep your own brain, I suppose?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would keep that."</p>

<p>"And I will keep my own nervous system," I
replied. "And the difference between mine and
yours is this: that whereas my own danger sense
is, or was, as keen as your own, I have my reserve
of nerve force&mdash;or had it&mdash;which might be relied
on to tide me over a sudden emergency. This
reserve you have expended on your brain. There
are two kinds of cowards; the selfish coward who
cares for no interest save his own; the unselfish
coward who cares nothing for himself, but who
cannot face a danger because he dare not. And
there are two kinds of brave men; the nerveless
man you spoke of, who simply faces danger because
he does not appreciate it, and the man who
faces danger because, although he fears it he dares
it. I have no difficulty in placing you in this list."</p>

<p>"You place me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A coward because you cannot help it. You
are merely out of harmony with your environment.
You ought to bring a supply of 'environment'
about with you, seeing that you cannot
manufacture it off-hand like myself. I wish to
be alone. Good-day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before I go, Marcel, I will say this." There
were tears in his eyes. "These people do not
really know you, with all their telepathic power.
You are not&mdash;not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not as great a fool as they think. Thank you.
I mean to prove that to them some day."</p>

<p>With that I turned away from him, although I
felt that he would have gladly stayed longer with
me.</p>

<p>While the <i>Esmeralda</i> was sweeping over the
long swells of the Mediterranean, I heard Brande
lecture for the second time. It was a fitting
interlude between his first and third addresses.
I might classify them thus&mdash;the first, critical;
the second, constructive; the third, executive.
His third speech was the last he made in the
world.</p>

<p>We were assembled in the saloon. It would
have been pleasanter on the upper deck, owing to
the heat, but the speaker could not then have
been easily heard in the noise of the wind and
waves. I could scarcely believe that it was
Brande who arose to speak, so changed was his
expression. The frank scepticism, which had only
recently degenerated into a cynicism, still tempered
with a half kindly air of easy superiority, was gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
In its place there was a look of concentrated and
relentless purpose which dominated the man himself
and all who saw him. He began in forcible
and direct sentences, with only a faintly reminiscent
eloquence which was part of himself, and
from which he could not without a conscious
effort have freed his style. But the whole bearing
of the man had little trace in it of the dilettante
academician whom we all remembered.</p>

<p>"When I last addressed this Society," he began,
"I laboured under a difficulty in arriving at
ultimate truth which was of my own manufacture.
I presupposed, as you will remember, the indestructibility
of the atom, and, in logical consequence
I was bound to admit the conservation of
suffering, the eternity of misery. But on that
evening many of my audience were untaught in
the rudiments of ultimate thought, and some were
still sceptical of the <i>bona fides</i> of our purpose, and
our power to achieve its object. To them, in their
then ineptitude, what I shall say now would have
been unintelligible. For in the same way that the
waves of light or sound exceeding a certain
maximum can not be transferred to the brain by
dull eyes and ears, my thought pulsations would
have escaped those auditors by virtue of their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
irresponsiveness. To-night I am free from the
limitation which I then suffered, because there are
none around me now who have not sufficient
knowledge to grasp what I shall present.</p>

<p>"You remember that I traced for you the story
of evolution in its journey from the atom to the
star. And I showed you that the hypothesis of
the indestructibility of the atom was simply a
creed of cruelty writ large. I now proceed on the
lines of true science to show you how that
hypothesis is false; that as the atom <i>is</i> destructible&mdash;as
you have seen by our experiments (the
last of which resulted in a climax not intended by
me)&mdash;the whole scheme of what is called creation
falls to pieces. As the atom was the first etheric
blunder, so the material Universe is the grand
etheric mistake.</p>

<p>"In considering the marvellous and miserable
succession of errors resulting from the meretricious
atomic remedy adopted by the ether to cure its
local sores, it must first be said of the ether itself
that there is too much of it. Space is not sufficient
for it. Thus, the particles of ether&mdash;those imponderable
entities which vibrate through a block
of marble or a disc of hammered steel with only a
dulled, not an annihilated motion, are by their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
own tumultuous plenty packed closer together
than they wish. I say wish, for if all material
consciousness and sentiency be founded on atomic
consciousness, then in its turn atomic consciousness
is founded upon, and dependent on, etheric consciousness.
These particles of ether, therefore,
when too closely impinged upon by their neighbours,
resent the impact, and in doing so initiate
etheric whirlwinds, from whose vast perturbances
stupendous drifts set out. In their gigantic power
these avalanches crush the particles which impede
them, force the resisting medium out of its normal
stage, destroy the homogeneity of its constituents,
and mass them into individualistic communities
whose vibrations play with greater freedom when
they synchronise. The homogeneous etheric
tendencies recede and finally determine.</p>

<p>"Behold a miracle! An atom is born!</p>

<p>"By a similar process&mdash;which I may liken to
that of putting off an evil day which some time
must be endured&mdash;the atoms group themselves into
molecules. In their turn the molecules go forth to
war, capturing or being captured; the vibrations
of the slaves always being forced to synchronise
with those of their conquerors. The nucleus of
the gas of a primal metal is now complete, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
foundation of a solar system&mdash;paltry molecule of
the Universe as it is&mdash;is laid. Thereafter, the rest
is easily followed. It is described in your school
books, and must not occupy me now.</p>

<p>"But one word I will interpolate which may
serve to explain a curious and interesting human
belief. You are aware of how, in times past, men
of absolutely no scientific insight held firmly to
the idea that an elixir of life and a philosopher's
stone might be discovered, and that these two
objects were nearly always pursued contemporaneously.
That is to my mind an extraordinary
example of the force of atomic consciousness.
The idea itself was absolutely correct; but the
men who followed it had slight knowledge of its
unity, and none whatever of its proper pursuit.
They would have worked on their special lines to
eternity before advancing a single step toward
their object. And this because they did not know
what life was, and death was, and what the metals
ultimately signified which they, blind fools, so
unsuccessfully tried to transmute. But we know
more than they. We have climbed no doubt in the
footholds they have carved, and we have gained
the summit they only saw in the mirage of hope.
For we know that there is no life, no death, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
metals, no matter, no emotions, no thoughts; but
that all that we call by these names is only the
ether in various conditions. Life! I could live
as long as this earth will submit to human existence
if I had studied that paltry problem.
Metals! The ship in which you sail was bought
with gold manufactured in my crucibles.</p>

<p>"The unintelligent&mdash;or I should say the grossly
ignorant&mdash;have long held over the heads of the
pioneers of science these two great charges: No
man has ever yet transmuted a metal; no man has
ever yet proved the connecting link between
organic and inorganic life. I say <i>life</i>, for I take
it that this company admits that a slab of granite
is as much alive as any man or woman I see
before me. But I have manufactured gold, and I
could have manufactured protoplasm if I had
devoted my life to that object. My studies have
been almost wholly on the inorganic plane. Hence
the 'philosopher's stone' came in my way, but
not the 'elixir of life.' The molecules of protoplasm
are only a little more complex than the
molecules of hydrogen or nitrogen or iron or coal.
You may fuse iron, vaporise water, intermix the
gases; but the molecules of all change little in
such metamorphosis. And you may slay twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thousand men at Waterloo or Sedan, or ten
thousand generations may be numbered with the
dust, and not an ounce of protoplasm lies dead.
All molecules are merely arrangements of atoms
made under different degrees of pressure and of
different ages. And all atoms are constructed of
identical constituents&mdash;the ether, as I have said.
Therefore the ether, which was from the beginning,
is now, and ever shall be, which is the
same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, is the origin
of force, of matter, of life.</p>

<p>"<i>It is alive!</i></p>

<p>"Its starry children are so many that the sands
of the sea-shore may not be used as a similitude for
their multitude; and they extend so far that distance
may not be named in relation to them.
They are so high above us and so deep below us
that there is neither height nor depth in them.
There is neither east nor west in them, nor north
and south in them. Nor is there beginning
or end to them. Time drops his scythe and
stands appalled before that dreadful host. Number
applies not to its eternal multitudes. Distance
is lost in boundless space. And from all the stars
that stud the caverns of the Universe, there swells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
this awful chorus: Failure! failure and futility!
And the ether is to blame!</p>

<p>"Heterogeneous suffering is more acute than
homogeneous, because the agony is intensified by
being localised; because the comfort of the comfortable
is purchasable only by the multiplied
misery of the miserable; because aristocratic
leisure requires that the poor should be always
with it. There is, therefore, no gladness without
its overbalancing sorrow. There is no good without
intenser evil. There is no death save in life.</p>

<p>"Back, then, from this ill-balanced and unfair
long-suffering, this insufficient existence. Back
to Nirvana&mdash;the ether! And I will lead the
way.</p>

<p>"The agent I will employ has cost me all life to
discover. It will release the vast stores of etheric
energy locked up in the huge atomic warehouse
of this planet. I shall remedy the grand mistake
only to a degree which it would be preposterous to
call even microscopic; but when I have done what
I can, I am blameless for the rest. In due season
the whole blunder will be cured by the same
means that I shall use, and all the hideous experiment
will be over, and everlasting rest or <i>quasi</i>-rest
will supersede the magnificent failure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
material existence. This earth, at least, and, I
am encouraged to hope, the whole solar system,
will by my instrumentality be restored to the
ether from which it never should have emerged.
Once before, in the history of our system, an
effort similar to mine was made, unhappily without
success.</p>

<p>"This time we shall not fail!"</p>

<p>A low murmur rose from the audience as the
lecturer concluded, and a hushed whisper asked:</p>

<p>"Where was that other effort made?"</p>

<p>Brande faced round momentarily, and said
quietly but distinctly:</p>

<p>"On the planet which was where the Asteroids
are now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>MISS METFORD'S PLAN.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> coaled at Port Said like any ordinary
steamer. Although I had more than once made
the Red Sea voyage, I had never before taken
the slightest interest in the coaling of the vessel
on which I was a passenger. This time everything
was different. That which interested me
before seemed trivial now. And that which
had before seemed trivial was now absorbing.
I watched the coaling&mdash;commonplace as the spectacle
was&mdash;with vivid curiosity. The red lights,
the sooty demons at work, every bag of coals
they carried, and all the coal dust clouds they
created, were fitting episodes in a voyage such
as ours. We took an enormous quantity of coal
on board. I remained up most of the night in
a frame of mind which I thought none might
envy. I myself would have made light of it
had I known what was still in store for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<i>Esmeralda</i> and her company. It was nearly
morning when I turned in. When I awoke we
were nearing the Red Sea.</p>

<p>On deck, the conversation of our party was
always eccentric, but this must be said for it:
there was sometimes a scintillating brilliance in
it that almost blinded one to its extreme
absurdity. The show of high spirits which was
very general was, in the main, unaffected. For
the rest it was plainly assumed. But those who
assumed their parts did so with a histrionic
power which was all the more surprising when
it is remembered that the origin of their excellent
playing was centred in their own fears. I
preserved a neutral attitude. I did not venture
on any overt act of insubordination.
That would have only meant my destruction,
without any counter-balancing advantage in
the way of baulking an enterprise in which I
was a most unwilling participator. And to
pretend what I did not feel was a task which
I had neither stomach to undertake nor ability
to carry out successfully. In consequence I kept
my own counsel&mdash;and that of Edith Metford.</p>

<p>Brande was the most easily approached maniac
I had ever met. His affability continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
absolutely consistent. I took advantage of this
to say to him on a convenient opportunity:
"Why did you bring these people with you?
They must all be useless, and many of them
little better than a nuisance!"</p>

<p>"Marcel, you are improving. Have you
attained the telepathic power? You have read
my mind." This was said with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>"I can not read your mind," I answered; "I
only diagnose."</p>

<p>"Your diagnosis is correct. I answer you in
a sentence. They are all sympathetic, and
human sympathy is necessary to me until my
purpose is fulfilled."</p>

<p>"You do not look to me for any measure of
this sympathy, I trust?"</p>

<p>"I do not. You are antipathetic."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"But necessary, all the same."</p>

<p>"So be it, until the proper time shall come."</p>

<p>"It will never come," Brande said firmly.</p>

<p>"We shall see," I replied as firmly as himself.</p>

<p>Next evening as we were steaming down the
blue waters&mdash;deep blue they always seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to me&mdash;of the Red Sea, I was sitting on the
foredeck smoking and trying to think. I did
not notice how the time passed. What seemed
to me an hour at most, must have been three
or four. With the exception of the men of
the crew who were on duty, I was alone, for
the heat was intense, and most of our people
were lying in their cabins prostrated in spite
of the wind-sails which were spread from every
port to catch the breeze. My meditations were
as usual gloomy and despondent. They were
interrupted by Miss Metford. She joined me
so noiselessly that I was not aware of her presence
until she laid her hand on my arm. I started
at her touch, but she whispered a sharp warning,
so full of suppressed emotion that I instantly
recovered a semblance of unconcern.</p>

<p>The girl was very white and nervous. This
contrast from her usual equanimity was disquieting.
She clung to me hysterically as she
gasped:</p>

<p>"Marcel, it is a mercy I have found you alone,
and that there is one sane man in this shipful
of lunatics."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not altogether right," I
said, as I placed a seat for her close to mine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
"I can hardly be sane when I am a voluntary
passenger on board this vessel."</p>

<p>"Do you really think they mean what they
say?" she asked hurriedly, without noticing my
remark.</p>

<p>"I really think they have discovered the secret
of extraordinary natural forces, so powerful and
so terrible that no one can say what they may
or may not accomplish. And that is the reason
I begged you not to come on this voyage."</p>

<p>"What was the good of asking me not to
come without giving me some reason?"</p>

<p>"Had I done so, they might have killed you
as they have done others before."</p>

<p>"You might have chanced that, seeing that
it will probably end that way."</p>

<p>"And they would certainly have killed me."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>I wondered at the sudden intensity of the girl's
sharp gasp when I said this, and marvelled too,
how she, who had always been so mannish, nestled
close to me and allowed her head to sink down
on my shoulder. I pitied the strong-willed,
self-reliant nature which had given way under
some strain of which I had yet to be told. So
I stooped and touched her cheek with my lips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in a friendly way, at which she looked up to me
with half-closed eyes, and whispered in a voice
strangely soft and womanish for her:</p>

<p>"If they must kill us, I wish they would kill
us now."</p>

<p>I stroked her soft cheek gently, and urged a
less hopeless view. "Even if the worst come,
we may as well live as long as we can."</p>

<p>Whereupon to my surprise she, having shot
one quick glance into my eyes, put my arm away
and drew her chair apart from mine. Her head
was turned away from me, but I could not but
notice that her bosom rose and fell swiftly.
Presently she faced round again, lit a cigarette,
put her hands in the pocket of her jacket, and
her feet on another chair, and said indifferently:</p>

<p>"You are right. Even if the worst must come,
we may as well live as long as we can."</p>

<p>This sudden change in her manner surprised
me. I knew I had no art in dealing with women,
so I let it pass without comment, and looked out
at the glassy sea.</p>

<p>After some minutes of silence, the girl spoke
to me again.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of the actual plans
of these maniacs?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I only know their preposterous purpose."</p>

<p>"Well, I know how it is to be done. Natalie
was restless last night&mdash;you know that we share
the same cabin&mdash;and she raved a bit. I kept her
in her berth by sheer force, but I allowed her
to talk."</p>

<p>This was serious. I drew my chair close to
Miss Metford's and whispered, "For heaven's
sake, speak low." Then I remembered Brande's
power, and wrung my hands in helpless impotence.
"You forget Brande. At this moment he is taking
down every word we say."</p>

<p>"He's doing nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"But you forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't forget. By accident I put morphia in
the tonic he takes, and he is now past telepathy
for some hours at least. He's sound asleep. I
suppose if I had not done it by accident he
would have known what I was doing, and so
have refused the medicine. Anyhow, accident or
no accident, I have done it."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" I cried.</p>

<p>"And this precious disintegrating agent! They
haven't it with them, it seems. To manufacture
it in sufficient quantity would be impossible in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
any civilised country without fear of detection
or interruption. Brande has the prescription,
formula&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;and if you could
get the paper and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Throw it overboard!"</p>

<p>"Rubbish! They would work it all out
again."</p>

<p>"What then?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Steal the paper and&mdash;wouldn't it do to put
in an extra <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>, or stick a couple of additional
figures into any suitable vacancy? Don't you
think they'd go on with the scheme and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"And make a mess of it!"</p>

<p>"Miss Metford," I said, rising from my chair,
"I mean Metford, I know you like to be addressed
as a man&mdash;or used to like it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I used to," she assented coldly.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you in my arms and kiss
you."</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if you are!" she exclaimed, so
sharply that I was suddenly abashed. My intended
familiarity and its expression appeared
grotesque, although a few minutes before she was
so friendly. But I could not waste precious time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in studying a girl's caprices, so I asked at
once:</p>

<p>"How can I get this paper?"</p>

<p>"I said <i>steal</i> it, if you recollect." Her voice
was now hard, almost harsh. "You can get it
in Brande's cabin, if you are neither afraid nor
jealous."</p>

<p>"I am not much afraid, and I will try it. What
do you mean by jealous?"</p>

<p>"I mean, would you, to save Natalie Brande&mdash;for
they will certainly succeed in blowing themselves
up, if nobody else&mdash;consent to her marrying
another man, say that young lunatic Halley,
who is always dangling after her when you are
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, after some thought. For
Halley's attentions to Natalie had been so marked,
the plainly inconsequent mention of him in this
matter did not strike me. "If that is necessary
to save her, of course I would consent to it.
Why do you ask? In my place you would do
the same."</p>

<p>"No. I'd see the ship and all its precious
passengers at the bottom of the sea first."</p>

<p>"Ah! but you are not a man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right! and what's more, I'm glad of it."
Then looking down at the rational part of her
costume, she added sharply, "I sha'n't wear these
things again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>ROCKINGHAM TO THE SHARKS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> one o'clock in the morning I arose, dressed
hurriedly, drew on a pair of felt slippers, and
put a revolver in my pocket. It was then time
to put Edith Metford's proposal to the proof, and
she would be waiting for me on deck to hear
whether I had succeeded in it. We had parted
a couple of hours before on somewhat chilling
terms. I had agreed to follow her suggestion,
but I could not trouble my tired brain by guesses
at the cause of her moods.</p>

<p>It was very dark. There was only enough
light to enable me to find my way along the
corridor, off which the state-rooms occupied by
Brande and his immediate lieutenants opened.
All the sleepers were restless from the terrible
heat. As I stole along, a muffled word, a sigh, or
a movement in the berths, made me pause at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
every step with a beating heart. Having listened
till all was quiet, I moved on again noiselessly.
I was almost at the end of the corridor. So intent
had I been on preserving perfect silence, it
did not sooner occur to me that I was searching
for any special door. I had forgotten Brande's
number!</p>

<p>I could no more think of it than one can recall
the name of a half-forgotten acquaintance suddenly
encountered in the street. It might have
been fourteen, or forty-one; or a hundred and
fifty. Every number was as likely as it was unlikely.
I tried vainly to concentrate my mind.
The result was nothing. The missing number
gave no clue. To enter the wrong room in that
ship at that hour meant death for me. Of that
I was certain. To leave the right room unentered
gave away my first chance in the unequal battle
with Brande. Then, as I knew that my first
chance would probably be my last, if not availed
of, I turned to the nearest door and quietly tried
the handle. The door was not locked. I entered
the state-room.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" It was Halley's voice
that came from the berth.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I whispered, "a mistake. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
heat, you know. Went on deck, and have blundered
into your room."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Brande."</p>

<p>"Good-night. You did not blunder far;" this
sleepily.</p>

<p>I went out and closed the door quietly. I had
gained something. I was within one door of my
destination, for I knew that Halley was berthed
between Rockingham and Brande. But I did not
know on which side Brande's room was, and I
dared not ask. I tried the next door going
forward. It opened like the other. I went in.</p>

<p>"Hallo there!" This time no sleepy or careless
man challenged me. It was Rockingham's
voice.</p>

<p>"May I not enter my own room?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"This is not your room. You are?" Rockingham
sprang up in his berth, but before he could
leave it I was upon him.</p>

<p>"I am Arthur Marcel. And this iron ring
which I press against your left ear is the muzzle
of my revolver. Speak, move, breathe above your
natural breath and your brains go through that
porthole. Now, loose your hold of my arm and
come with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"You fool!" hissed Rockingham. "You dare not
fire. You know you dare not."</p>

<p>He was about to call out, but my left hand
closed on his throat, and a gurgling gasp was all
that issued from him.</p>

<p>I laid down the revolver and turned the ear of
the strangling man close to my mouth. I had
little time to think; but thought flies fast when
such deadly peril menaces the thinker as that
which I must face if I failed to make terms with
the man who was in my power. I knew that notwithstanding
his intensely disagreeable nature,
if he gave his promise either by spoken word or
equivalent sign, I could depend upon him. There
were no liars in Brande's Society. But the word I
could not trust him to say. I must have his sign.
I whispered:</p>

<p>"You know I do not wish to kill you. I shall
never have another happy day if you force me to
it. I have no choice. You must yield or die. If
you will yield and stand by me rather than against
me in what shall follow, choose life by taking your
right hand from my wrist and touching my left
shoulder. I will not hurt you meanwhile. If you
choose death, touch me with your left."</p>

<p>The sweat stood on my forehead in big beads as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
I waited for his choice. It was soon made. He
unlocked his left hand and placed it firmly on my
right shoulder.</p>

<p>He had chosen death.</p>

<p>So the man was only a physical coward&mdash;or
perhaps he had only made a choice of alternatives.</p>

<p>I said slowly and in great agony, "May God
have mercy on your soul&mdash;and mine!" on which
the muscles in my left arm stiffened. The big
biceps&mdash;an heirloom of my athletic days&mdash;thickened
up, and I turned my eyes away from the dying
face, half hidden by the darkness. His struggles
were very terrible, but with my weight upon his
lower limbs, and my grasp upon his windpipe, that
death-throe was as silent as it was horrible. The
end came slowly. I could not bear the horror of
it longer. I must finish it and be done with it.
I put my right arm under the man's shoulders and
raised the upper part of his body from the berth.
Then a desperate wrench with my left arm, and
there was a dull crack like the snapping of a
dry stick. It was over. Rockingham's neck
was broken.</p>

<p>I wiped away the bloody froth that oozed from
the gaping mouth, and tried to compose decently
the contorted figure. I covered the face. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
I started on my last mission, for now I knew the
door. I had bought the knowledge dearly, and
I meant to use it for my own purpose, careless of
what violence might be necessary to accomplish
my end.</p>

<p>When I entered Brande's state-room I found the
electric light full on. He was seated at a writing-table
with his head resting on his arms, which
hung crossways over the desk. The sleeper
breathed so deeply it was evident that the effect
of the morphia was still strong upon him. One
hand clutched a folded parchment. His fingers
clasped it nervelessly, and I had only to force them
open one by one in order to withdraw the manuscript.
As I did this, he moaned and moved in his
chair. I had no fear of his awaking. My hand
shook as I unfolded the parchment which I unconsciously
handled as carefully as though the
thing itself were as deadly as the destruction
which might be wrought by its direction.</p>

<p>To me the whole document was a mass of
unintelligible formul&aelig;. My rusty university
education could make nothing of it. But I could
not waste time in trying to solve the puzzle,
for I did not know what moment some other
visitor might arrive to see how Brande fared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
I first examined with a pocket microscope the
ink of the manuscript, and then making a scratch
with Brande's pen on a page of my note-book,
I compared the two. The colours were identical.
It was the same ink.</p>

<p>In several places where a narrow space had
been left vacant, I put 1 in front of the figures
which followed. I had no reason for making
this particular alteration, save that the figure 1
is more easily forged than any other, and the
forgery is consequently more difficult to detect.
My additions, when the ink was dry, could only
have been discovered by one who was informed
that the document had been tampered with.
It was probable that a drawer which stood open
with the keys in the lock was the place where
Brande kept this paper; where he would look
for it on awaking. I locked it in the drawer
and put the keys into his pocket.</p>

<p>There was something still to do with the sleeping
man, whose brain compassed such marvellous
powers. His telepathic faculty must be destroyed.
I must keep him seriously ill, without killing
him. As long as he remained alive his friends
would never question his calculations, and the
fiasco which was possible under any circumstances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
would then be assured. I had with me an
Eastern drug, which I had bought from an
Indian fakir once in Murzapoor. The man was
an impostor, whose tricks did not impose on
me. But the drug, however he came by it, was
reliable. It was a poison which produced a
mild form of cerebritis that dulled but did not
deaden the mental powers. It acted almost
identically whether administered sub-cutaneously
or, of course in a larger dose, internally. I
brought it home with the intention of giving
it to a friend who was interested in vivisection.
I did not think that I myself should be the
first and last to experiment with it. It served
my purpose well.</p>

<p>The moment I pricked his skin, Brande moved
in his seat. My hand was on his throat. He
nestled his head down again upon his arms, and
drew a deep breath. Had he moved again that
breath would have been his last. I had been
so wrought upon by what I had already done
that night, I would have taken his life without
the slightest hesitation, if the sacrifice seemed
necessary.</p>

<p>When my operation was over, I left the room
and moved silently along the corridor till I came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to the ladder leading to the deck. Edith Metford
was waiting for me as we had arranged. She
was shivering in spite of the awful heat.</p>

<p>"Have you done it?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"I have," I answered, without saying how
much I had done. "Now you must retire&mdash;and
rest easy. The formula won't work. I
have put both it and Brande himself out of
gear."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she gasped, and then a sudden
faintness came over her. It passed quickly,
and as soon as she was sufficiently restored, I
begged her to go below. She pleaded that she
could not sleep, and asked me to remain with
her upon the deck. "It would be absurd to
suppose that either of us could sleep this night,"
she very truly said. On which I was obliged
to tell her plainly that she must go below. I
had more to do.</p>

<p>"Can I help?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No. If you could, I would ask you, for you
are a brave girl. I have something now to get
through which is not woman's work."</p>

<p>"Your work is my work," she answered. "What
is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have to lower a body overboard without
anyone observing me."</p>

<p>There was no time for discussion, so I told her
at once, knowing that she would not give way
otherwise. She started at my words, but said
firmly:</p>

<p>"How will you do that unobserved by the
'watch'? Go down and bring up your&mdash;bring
it up. I will keep the men employed." She
went forward, and I turned again to the companion.</p>

<p>When I got back to Rockingham's cabin I took
a sheet of paper and wrote, "Heat&mdash;Mad!" making
no attempt to imitate his writing. I simply
scrawled the words with a rough pen in the hope
that they would pass as a message from a man
who was hysterical when he wrote them. Then
I turned to the berth and took up the body. It
was not a pleasant thing to do. But it must be
done.</p>

<p>I was a long time reaching the deck, for the
arms and legs swung to and fro, and I had to
move cautiously lest they should knock against
the woodwork I had to pass. I got it safely up
and hurried aft with it. Edith, I knew, would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
contrive to keep the men on watch engaged until
I had disposed of my burden. I picked up a coil
of rope and made it fast to the dead man's neck.
Taking one turn of the rope round a boat-davit, I
pushed the thing over the rail. I intended to let
go the rope the moment the weight attached to it
was safely in the sea, and so lowered away
silently, paying out the line without excessive
strain owing to the support of the davit round
which I had wound it. I had not to wait so long
as that, for just as the body was dangling over
the foaming wake of the steamer, a little streak
of moonlight shot out from behind a bank of
cloud and lighted the vessel with a sudden gleam.
I was startled by this, and held on, fearing that
some watching eye might see my curious movements.
For a minute I leaned over the rail and
watched the track of the steamer as though I had
come on deck for the air. There was a quick
rush near the vessel's quarter. Something dark
leaped out of the water, and there was a sharp
snap&mdash;a crunch. The lower limbs were gone in
the jaws of a shark. I let go the rope in horror,
and the body dropped splashing into that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
hideous fishing-ground. Sick to death I turned
away.</p>

<p>"Get below quickly," Edith Metford said in my
ear. "They heard the splash, slight as it was,
and are coming this way." Her warning was
nearly a sob.</p>

<p>We hurried down the companion as fast as
we dared, and listened to the comments of the
watch above. They were soon satisfied that nothing
of importance had occurred, and resumed
their stations.</p>

<p>Before we parted on that horrible night, Edith
said in a trembling voice, "You have done your
work like a brave man."</p>

<p>"Say rather, like a forger and murderer," I
answered.</p>

<p>"No," she maintained. "Many men before you
have done much worse in a good cause. You are
not a forger. You are a diplomat. You are not a
murderer. You are a hero."</p>

<p>But I, being new to this work of slaughter and
deception, could only deprecate her sympathy and
draw away. I felt that my very presence near
her was pollution. I was unclean, and I told her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that I was so. Whereupon, without hesitation,
she put her arms round my neck, and said clinging
closely to me:</p>

<p>"You are not unclean&mdash;you are free from guilt.
And&mdash;Arthur&mdash;I will kiss you now."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<small>"IF NOT TOO LATE!"</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I came on deck next morning the coast of
Arabia was rising, a thin thread of hazy blue between
the leaden grey of the sea and the soft grey
of the sky. The morning was cloudy, and the
blazing sunlight was veiled in atmospheric gauze.
I had hardly put my foot on deck when Natalie
Brande ran to meet me. I hung back guiltily.</p>

<p>"I thought you would never come. There is
dreadful news!" she cried.</p>

<p>I muttered some incoherent words, to which
she did not attend, but went on hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Rockingham has thrown himself overboard in
a hysterical fit, brought on by the heat. The
sailors heard the splash&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know they did." This escaped me unawares,
and I instantly prevaricated, "I have been told
about that."</p>

<p>"Do you know that Herbert is ill?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>I could have conscientiously answered this
question affirmatively also. Her sudden sympathy
for human misadventure jarred upon me,
as it had done once before, when I thought of the
ostensible object of the cruise. I said harshly:</p>

<p>"Then Rockingham is at rest, and your brother
is on the road to it." It was a brutal speech. It
had a very different effect to that which I intended.</p>

<p>"True," she said. "But think of the awful
consequences if, now that Rockingham is gone,
Herbert should be seriously ill."</p>

<p>"I do think of it," I said stiffly. Indeed, I
could hardly keep from adding that I had provided
for it.</p>

<p>"You must come to him at once. I have
faith in you." This gave me a twinge. "I
have no faith in Percival" (the ship's doctor).</p>

<p>"You are nursing your brother?" I said with
assumed carelessness.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"What is Percival giving him?"</p>

<p>She described the treatment, and as this was
exactly what I myself would have prescribed to
put my own previous interference right, I promised
to come at once, saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is quite evident that Percival does not
understand the case."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I thought," Natalie
agreed, leading me to Brande's cabin. I found
his vitality lower than I expected, and he was
very impatient. The whole purpose of his life
was at stake, dependent on his preserving a
healthy body, on which, in turn, a vigorous mind
depends.</p>

<p>"How soon can you get me up?" he asked
sharply, when my pretended examination was over.</p>

<p>"I should say a month at most."</p>

<p>"That would be too long," he cried. "You
must do it in less."</p>

<p>"It does not depend on me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It does depend on you. I know life itself.
You know the paltry science of organic life.
I have had no time for such trivial study.
Get me well within three days, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am attending."</p>

<p>"By the hold over my sister's imagination
which I have gained, I will kill her on the
fourth morning from now."</p>

<p>"You will&mdash;<i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"I tell you I will," Brande shrieked, starting
up in his berth. "I could do it now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"You could&mdash;<i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"Man, do you know what you are saying?
You to bandy words with me! A clod-brained
fool to dare a man of science! Man of science
forsooth! Your men of science are to me as
brain-benumbed, as brain-bereft, as that fly which
I crush&mdash;thus!"</p>

<p>The buzzing insect was indeed dead. But I
was something more than a fly. At last I was on
a fair field with this scientific magician or madman.
And on a fair field I was not afraid of
him.</p>

<p>"You are agitating yourself unnecessarily and
injuriously," I said in my best professional manner.
"And if you persist in doing so you will
make my one month three."</p>

<p>In a voice of undisguised scorn, Brande exclaimed,
without noticing my interruption:</p>

<p>"Bearded by a creature whose little mind is to
me like the open page of a book to read when the
humour seizes me." Then with a fierce glance at
me he cried:</p>

<p>"I have read your mind before. I can read it
now."</p>

<p>"You can&mdash;<i>not</i>."</p>

<p>He threw himself back in his berth and strove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to concentrate his mind. For nearly five minutes
he lay quite still, and then he said gently:</p>

<p>"You are right. Have you, then, a higher
power than I?"</p>

<p>"No; a lower!"</p>

<p>"A lower! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I have merely paralysed your
brain&mdash;that for many months to come it will not
be restored to its normal power&mdash;that it will
never reach its normal power again unless I
choose."</p>

<p>"Then all is lost&mdash;lost&mdash;lost!" he wailed out.
"The end is as far off, and the journey as long,
and the way as hard, as if I had never striven.
And the tribute of human tears will be exacted
to the uttermost. My life has been in vain!"</p>

<p>The absolute agony in his voice, the note of
almost superhuman suffering and despair, was so
intense, that, without thinking of what it was
this man was grieving over, I found myself saying
soothingly:</p>

<p>"No, no! Nothing is lost. It is only your
own overstrained nervous system which sends
these fantastic nightmares to your brain. I will
soon make you all right if you will listen to
reason."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to me with the most appealing look
which I had ever seen in human eyes save once
before&mdash;when Natalie pleaded with me.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," he said, "the issue now lies
in your hands. Choose rightly. Choose mercy."</p>

<p>"I will," I answered shortly, for his request
brought me back with a jerk to his motive.</p>

<p>"Then you will get me well as soon as your
skill can do it?"</p>

<p>"I will keep you in your present condition
until I have your most solemn assurance that
you will neither go farther yourself nor instigate
others to go farther with this preposterous scheme
of yours."</p>

<p>"Bah!" Brande ejaculated contemptuously, and
lay back with a sudden content. "My brain is
certainly out of order, else I should not have
forgotten&mdash;until your words recalled it&mdash;the Labrador
expedition."</p>

<p>"The Labrador expedition?"</p>

<p>"Yes. On the day we sailed for the Arafura
Sea, Grey started with another party for Labrador.
If we fail to act before the 31st December, in the
year 1900, he will proceed. And the end of the
century will be the date of the end of the earth.
I will signal to him now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>His face changed suddenly. For a moment I
thought he was dead. Then the dreadful fact
came home to me. He was telegraphing telepathically
to Grey. So the murder that was
upon my soul had been done in vain. Then
another life must be taken. Better a double
crime than one resultless tragedy. I was spared
this.</p>

<p>Brande opened his eyes wearily, and sighed
as if fatigued. The effort, short as it was, must
have been intense. He was prostrated. His
voice was low, almost a whisper, as he said:</p>

<p>"You have succeeded beyond belief. I cannot
even signal him, much less exchange ideas." With
that he turned his face from me, and instantly
fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>I left the cabin and went on deck. As usual,
it was fairly sprinkled over with the passengers,
but owing to the strong head-wind caused by the
speed of the steamer, there was a little nook in
the bow where there was no one to trouble me
with unwelcome company.</p>

<p>I sat down on an arm of the starboard anchor
and tried to think. The game which seemed so
nearly won had all to be played over again from
the first move. If I had killed Brande&mdash;which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
surely would have been justifiable&mdash;the other
expedition would go on from where he left off.
And how should I find them? And who would
believe my story when I got back to England?</p>

<p>Brande must go on. His attempt to wreck
the earth, even if the power he claimed were
not overrated, would fail. For if the compounds
of a common explosive must be so nicely balanced
as they require to be, surely the addition of the
figures which I had made in his formula would
upset the balance of constituents in an agent so
delicate, though so powerful, as that which he
had invented. When the master failed, it was
more than probable that the pupil would distrust
the invention, and return to London for
fresh experiments. Then a clean sweep must be
made of the whole party. Meantime, it was plain
that Brande must be allowed the opportunity
of failing. And this it would be my hazardous
duty to superintend.</p>

<p>I returned to Brande's cabin with my mind
made up. He was awake, and looked at me
eagerly, but waited for me to speak. Our conversation
was brief, for I had little sympathy
with my patient, and the only anxiety I experienced
about his health was the hope that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
would not die until he had served my purpose.</p>

<p>"I have decided to get you up," I said
curtly.</p>

<p>"You have decided well," he answered, with
equal coldness.</p>

<p>That was the whole interview&mdash;on which so
much depended.</p>

<p>After this I did not speak to Brande on any
subject but that of his symptoms, and before long
he was able to come on deck. The month I spoke
of as the duration of his illness was an intentional
exaggeration on my part.</p>

<p>Rockingham was forgotten with a suddenness
and completeness that was almost ghastly. The
Society claimed to have improved the old maxim
to speak nothing of the dead save what is good.
Of the dead they spoke not at all. It is a
callous creed, but in this instance it pleased me
well.</p>

<p>We did not touch at Aden, and I was glad of
it. The few attractions of the place, the diving
boys and the like, may be a relief in ordinary
sea voyages, but I was too much absorbed in my
experiment on Brande to bear with patience any
delay which served to postpone the crisis of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
scheme. I had treated him well, so far as his
bodily health went, but I deliberately continued
to tamper with his brain, so that any return of
his telepathic power was thus prevented. Indeed,
Brande himself was not anxious for such return.
The power was always exercised at an extreme
nervous strain, and it was now, he said, unnecessary
to his purpose.</p>

<p>In consequence of this determination, I modified
the already minute doses of the drug I was
giving him. This soon told with advantage on
his health. His physical improvement partly
restored his confidence in me, so that he followed
my instructions faithfully. He evidently recognised
that he was in my power; that if I did
not choose to restore him fully no other man
could.</p>

<p>Of the ship's officers, Anderson, who was in
command, and Percival, the doctor, were men of
some individuality. The captain was a good
sailor and an excellent man of business. In the
first capacity, he was firm, exacting, and scrupulously
conscientious. In the second, his conscience
was more elastic when he saw his way clear to
his own advantage. He had certain rigid rules
of conduct which he prided himself on observing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to the letter, without for a moment suspecting
that their <i>raison d'etre</i> lay in his own interests.
His commercial morality only required him to
keep within the law. His final contract with
myself was, I admit, faithfully carried out, but
the terms of it would not have discredited the
most predatory business man in London town.</p>

<p>Percival was the opposite pole of such a character.
He was a clever man, who might have
risen in his profession but for his easy-going
indolence. I spent many an hour in his cabin.
He was a sportsman and a skilled <i>raconteur</i>. His
anecdotes helped to while the weary time away.
He exaggerated persistently, but this did not
disturb me. Besides, if in his narratives he
lengthened out the hunt a dozen miles and increased
the weight of the fish to an impossible
figure, made the brace a dozen and the ten-ton
boat a man-of-war, it was not because he was
deliberately untruthful. He looked back on his
feats through the telescope of a strongly magnifying
memory. It was more agreeable to me
to hear him boast his prowess than have him
inquire after the health and treatment of my
patient Brande. On this matter he was naturally
very curious, and I very reticent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>That Brande did not entirely trust me was evident
from his confusion when I surprised him
once reading his formula. His anxiety to convince
me that it was only a commonplace memorandum
was almost ludicrous. I was glad to see
him anxious about that document. The more
carefully he preserved it, and the more faithfully
he adhered to its conditions, the better for my
experiment. A sense of security followed this
incident. It did not last long. It ended that
evening.</p>

<p>After a day of almost unendurable heat, I
went on deck for a breath of air. We were
well out in the Indian Ocean, and soundings
were being attempted by some of our naturalists.
I sat alone and watched the sun sink
down into the glassy ocean on which our rushing
vessel was the only thing that moved. As the
darkness of that hot, still night gathered, weird
gleams of phosphorus broke from the steamer's
bows and streamed away behind us in long
lines of flashing spangles. Where the swell
caused by the passage of the ship rose in curling
waves, these, as they splashed into mimic
breakers, burst into showers of flamboyant light.
The water from the discharge-pipe poured down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in a cascade, that shone like silver. Every turn
of the screw dashed a thousand flashes on either
side, and the heaving of the lead was like the
flight of a meteor, as it plunged with a luminous
trail far down into the dark unfathomable depths
below.</p>

<p>My name was spoken softly. Natalie Brande
stood beside me. The spell was complete. The
unearthly glamour of the magical scene had
been compassed by her. She had called it forth
and could disperse it by an effort of her will.
I wrenched my mind free from the foolish
phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>"I have good news," Natalie said in a low
voice. Her tones were soft, musical; her manner
caressing. Happiness was in her whole bearing,
tenderness in her eyes. Dread oppressed me.
"Herbert is now well again."</p>

<p>"He has been well for some time," I said,
my heart beating fast.</p>

<p>"He is not thoroughly restored even yet. But
this evening he was able to receive a message
from me by the thought waves. He thinks you
are plotting injury to him. His brain is not yet
sufficiently strong to show how foolish this fugitive
fancy is. Perhaps you would go to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
He is troubling himself over this. You can set
his mind at rest."</p>

<p>"I can&mdash;and will&mdash;if I am not too late," I
answered.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<small>&pound;5000 TO DETAIN THE SHIP.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Brande</span> was asleep when I entered his cabin.
His writing-table was covered with scraps of paper
on which he had been scribbling. My name was
on every scrap, preceded or followed by an unfinished
sentence, thus: "Marcel is thinking&mdash; When
I was ill, Marcel thought&mdash; Marcel means
to&mdash;" All these I gathered up carefully and put
in my pocket. Then I inoculated him with as
strong a solution of the drug I was using on him
as was compatible with the safety of his life.
Immediate danger being thus averted, I determined
to run no similar risk again.</p>

<p>For many days after this our voyage was monotonous.
The deadly secret shared by Edith Metford
and myself drew us gradually nearer to each
other as time passed. She understood me, or, at
least, gave me the impression that she understood
me. Little by little that capricious mood which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
have heretofore described changed into one of enduring
sympathy. With one trivial exception,
this lasted until the end. But for her help my
mind would hardly have stood the strain of events
which were now at hand, whose livid shadows
were projected in the rising fire of Brande's relentless
eyes.</p>

<p>Brande appeared to lose interest gradually in
his ship's company. He became daily more and
more absorbed in his own thoughts. Natalie was
ever gentle, even tender. But I chafed at the
impalpable barrier which was always between us.
Sometimes I thought that she would willingly
have ranged herself on my side. Some hidden
power held her back. As to the others, I began to
like the boy Halley. He was lovable, if not
athletic. His devotion to Natalie, which never
waned, did not now trouble me. It was only a
friendship, and I welcomed it. Had it been anything
more, it was not likely that he would have
prevailed against the will of a man who had done
murder for his mistress. We steamed through the
Malay Archipelago, steering north, south, east,
west, as if at haphazard, until only the navigating
officers and the director of the Society knew how
our course lay. We were searching for an island<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
about the bearings of which, it transpired, some
mistake had been made. I do not know whether
the great laureate ever sailed these seas. But I
know that his glorious islands of flowers and
islands of fruit, with all their luscious imagery,
were here eclipsed by our own islands of foliage.
The long lagoons, the deep blue bays, the glittering
parti-coloured fish that swam in visible shoals
deep down amidst the submerged coral groves
over which we passed, the rich-toned sea-weeds
and brilliant anemones, the yellow strands and
the steep cliffs, the riotous foliage that swept down
from the sky to the blue of the sea; all these
natural beauties seemed to cry to me with living
voices&mdash;to me bound on a cruise of universal
death.</p>

<p>After a long spell of apparently aimless but
glorious steaming, a small island was sighted on
our port bow. The <i>Esmeralda</i> was steered
directly for it, and we dropped anchor in a deep
natural harbour on its southern shore. Preparations
for landing had been going on during the
day, and everything was ready for quitting the
ship.</p>

<p>It was here that my first opportunity for making
use of the gold I had brought with me occurred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Anderson was called up by Brande, who made him
a short complimentary speech, and finished it by
ordering his officer to return to England, where
further instructions would be given him. This
order was received in respectful silence. Captain
Anderson had been too liberally treated to demur
if the <i>Esmeralda</i> had been ordered to the South
Pole.</p>

<p>Brande went below for a few minutes, and as
soon as he had disappeared I went forward to
Anderson and hailed him nervously, for there
was not a moment to spare.</p>

<p>"Anderson," I said hurriedly, "you must have
noticed that Mr. Brande is an eccentric&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir; it is not my business to
comment upon my owner."</p>

<p>"I did not ask you to comment upon him,
sir," I said sharply. "It is I who shall comment
upon him, and it is for you to say whether
you will undertake to earn my money by waiting
in this harbour till I am ready to sail back
with you to England."</p>

<p>"Have you anything more to say, sir?" Anderson
asked stiffly.</p>

<p>"I presume I have said enough."</p>

<p>"If you have nothing more to say I must ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
you to leave the bridge, and if it were not that
you are leaving the ship this moment, I would
caution you not to be impertinent to me again."</p>

<p>He blew his whistle, and a steward ran forward.</p>

<p>"Johnson, see Mr. Marcel's luggage over the
side at once." To me he said shortly: "Quit
my ship, sir."</p>

<p>This trivial show of temper, which, indeed,
had been provoked by my own hasty speech,
turned my impatience into fury.</p>

<p>"Before I quit your ship," I said, with emphasis,
"I will tell you how you yourself will quit
it. You will do so between two policemen if
you land in England, and between two marines
if you think of keeping on the high seas. Before
we started, I sent a detailed statement of this
ship, the nature of this nefarious voyage, and
the names of the passengers&mdash;or as many as I
knew&mdash;to a friend who will put it in proper
hands if anything befalls me. Go back without
me and explain the loss of that French fishing
fleet which was sunk the very night we sailed.
It is an awkward coincidence to be explained
by a man who returns from an unknown voyage
having lost his entire list of passengers. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cannot be aware of what this man Brande intends,
or you would at least stand by us as long
as your own safety permitted. In any case you
cannot safely return without us."</p>

<p>Anderson, after reflecting for a moment, apologised
for his peremptory words, and agreed to stand
by night and day, with fires banked, until I, and
all whom I could prevail upon to return with
me, got back to his vessel. There was no danger
of his running short of coal. A ship that was
practically an ocean liner in coal ballast would
be a considerable time in burning out her own
cargo. But he insisted on a large money payment
in advance. I had foolishly mentioned
that I had a little over &pound;5000 in gold. This
he claimed on the plea that "in duty to himself"&mdash;a
favourite phrase of his&mdash;he could not accept
less. But I think his sense of duty was limited
only by the fact that I had hardly another
penny in the world. Under the circumstances
he might have waived all remuneration. As
he was firm, and as I had no time to haggle,
I agreed to give him the money. Our bargain
was only completed when Brande returned to
the deck.</p>

<p>It was strange that on an island like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
on which we were landing there should be a
regular army of natives waiting to assist us
with our baggage, and the saddled horses which
were in readiness were out of place in a primeval
wilderness. An Englishman came forward, and,
saluting Brande, said all was ready for the start
to the hills. This explained the puzzle. An
advance agent had made everything comfortable.
For Brande, his sister, and Miss Metford the
best appointed horses were selected. I, as
physician to the chief, had one. The main body
had to make the journey on foot, which they
did by very easy stages, owing to the heat and
the primitive track which formed the only road.
Their journey was not very long&mdash;perhaps ten
miles in a direct line.</p>

<p>Mounted as we were, it was often necessary
to stoop to escape the dense masses of parasitic
growth which hung in green festoons from every
branch of the trees on either side. Under this
thick shade all the riotous vegetation of the
tropics had fought for life and struggled for light
and air till the wealth of their luxuriant death
had carpeted the underwood with a thick deposit
of steaming foliage. As we ascended the
height, every mile in distance brought changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in the botanical growths, which might have passed
unnoticed by the ordinary observer or ignorant
pioneer. All were noted and commented on by
Brande, whose eye was still as keen as his brain
had once been brilliant. His usual staid demeanour
changed suddenly. He romped ahead of us
like a schoolboy out for a holiday. Unlike a
schoolboy, however, he was always seeking new
items of knowledge and conveying them to us
with unaffected pleasure. He was more like a
master who had found new ground and new
material for his class. Natalie gave herself up
like him to this enjoyment of the moment. Edith
Metford and I partly caught the glamour of their
infectious good-humour. But with both of us
it was tempered by the knowledge of what was
in store.</p>

<p>When we arrived at our destination we dismounted,
at Brande's request, and tied our horses
to convenient branches. He went forward, and,
pushing aside the underwood with both hands,
motioned to us to follow him till he stopped on a
ledge of rock which overtopped a hollow in the
mountain. The gorge below was the most beautiful
glade I ever looked upon.</p>

<p>It was a paradise of foliage. Here and there a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fallen tree had formed a picturesque bridge over
the mountain stream which meandered through it.
Far down below there was a waterfall, where
gorgeous tree-ferns rose in natural bowers, while
others further still leant over the lotus-covered
stream, their giant leaves trailing in the slow-moving
current. Tangled masses of bracken
rioted in wild abundance over a velvety green sod,
overshadowed by waving magnolias. Through the
trees bright-plumaged birds were flitting from
branch to branch in songless flight, flashing their
brilliant colours through the sunny leaves. In
places the water splashed over moss-grown rocks
into deep pools. Every drifting spray of cloud
threw over the dell a new light, deepening the
shadows under the great ferns.</p>

<p>It was here in this glorious fairyland; here upon
this island, where before us no white foot had
ever trod; whose nameless people represented the
simplest types of human existence, that Herbert
Brande was to put his devilish experiment to the
proof. I marvelled that he should have selected so
fair a spot for so terrible a purpose. But the
papers which I found later amongst the man's
effects on the <i>Esmeralda</i> explain much that was
then incomprehensible to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Our camp was quickly formed, and our life was
outwardly as happy as if we had been an ordinary
company of tourists. I say outwardly, because,
while we walked and climbed and collected specimens
of botanical or geological interest, there
remained that latent dread which always followed
us, and dominated the most frivolous of our people,
on all of whom a new solemnity had fallen. For
myself, the fact that the hour of trial for my own
experiment was daily drawing closer and more
inevitable, was sufficient to account for my constant
and extreme anxiety.</p>

<p>Brande joined none of our excursions. He was
always at work in his improvised laboratory. The
boxes of material which had been brought from
the ship nearly filled it from floor to roof, and
from the speed with which these were emptied, it
was evident that their contents had been systematised
before shipment. In place of the varied
collection of substances there grew up within the
room a cone of compound matter in which all were
blended. This cone was smaller, Brande admitted,
than what he had intended. The supply of subordinate
fulminates, though several times greater
than what was required, proved to be considerably
short. But as he had allowed himself a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
margin&mdash;everything being on a scale far exceeding
the minimum which his calculations had pointed
to as sufficient&mdash;this deficiency did not cause him
more than a temporary annoyance. So he worked
on.</p>

<p>When we had been three weeks on the island I
found the suspense greater than I could bear. The
crisis was at hand, and my heart failed me. I
determined to make a last appeal to Natalie, to fly
with me to the ship. Edith Metford would accompany
us. The rest might take the risk to which
they had consented.</p>

<p>I found Natalie standing on the high rock
whence the most lovely view of the dell could be
obtained, and as I approached her silently she was
not aware of my presence until I laid my hand
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Natalie," I said wistfully, for the girl's eyes
were full of tears, "do you mind if I withdraw
now from this enterprise, in which I cannot be
of the slightest use, and of which I most heartily
disapprove?"</p>

<p>"The Society would not allow you to withdraw.
You cannot do so without its permission,
and hope to live within a thousand miles of
it," she answered gravely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not care to live within ten thousand
miles of it. I should try to get and keep the
earth's diameter between myself and it."</p>

<p>She looked up with an expression of such pain
that my heart smote me. "How about me?
I cannot live without you now," she said
softly.</p>

<p>"Don't live without me. Come with me. Get
rid of this infamous association of lunatics, whose
object they themselves cannot really appreciate,
and whose means are murder&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there she stopped me. "My brother could
find me out at the uttermost ends of the earth if
I forsook him, and you know I do not mean to
forsake him. For yourself&mdash;do not try to desert.
It would make no difference. Do not believe
that any consideration would cause me willingly
to give you a moment's pain, or that I should
shrink from sacrificing myself to save you."
With one of her small white hands she gently
pressed my head towards her. Her lips touched
my forehead, and she whispered: "Do not leave
me. It will soon be over now. I&mdash;I&mdash;need
you."</p>

<p>As I was returning dejected after my fruitless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
appeal to Natalie, I met Edith Metford, to whom
I had unhappily mentioned my proposal for an
escape.</p>

<p>"Is it arranged? When do we start?" she
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is not arranged, and we do not start," I
answered in despair.</p>

<p>"You told me you would go with her or without
her," she cried passionately. "It is shameful&mdash;unmanly."</p>

<p>"It is certainly both if I really said what you
tell me. I was not myself at the moment, and
my tongue must have slandered me. I stay to the
end. But you will go. Captain Anderson will
receive you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How am I to be certain of that?"</p>

<p>"I paid him for your passage, and have his
receipt."</p>

<p>"And you really think I would go and leave&mdash;leave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Natalie? I think you would be perfectly
justified."</p>

<p>At this the girl stamped her foot passionately
on the ground and burst into tears. Nor would
she permit any of the slight caresses I offered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
I thought her old caprices were returning. She
flung my arm rudely from her and left me bewildered.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<small>"THIS EARTH SHALL DIE."</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> memory does not serve me well in the scenes
which immediately preceded the closing of the
drama in which Brande was chief actor. It is
doubtless the transcendental interest of the final
situation which blunts my recollection of what
occurred shortly before it. I did not abate one
jot of my determination to fight my venture
out unflinching, but my actions were probably
more automatic than reasoned, as the time of
our last encounter approached. On the whole,
the fight had been a fair one. Brande had used
his advantage over me for his own purpose as
long as it remained with him. I used the advantage
as soon as it passed to me for mine.
The conditions had thus been equalised when,
for the third and last time, I was to hear him
address his Society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>This time the man was weak in health. His
vitality was ebbing fast, but his marvellous inspiration
was strong within him, and, supported
by it, he battled manfully with the disease
which I had manufactured for him. His lecture-room
was the fairy glen; his canopy the
heavens.</p>

<p>I cannot give the substance of this address,
or any portion of it, verbatim as on former
occasions, for I have not the manuscript. I doubt
if Brande wrote out his last speech. Methodical
as were his habits it is probable that his final
words were not premeditated. They burst from
him in a delirium that could hardly have been
studied. His fine frenzy could not well have
originated from considered sentences, although
his language, regarded as mere oratory, was
magnificent. It was appalling in the light
through which I read it.</p>

<p>He stood alone upon the rock which overtopped
the dell. We arranged ourselves in such groups
as suited our inclinations, upon some rising
ground below. The great trees waved overhead,
low murmuring. The waterfall splashed drearily.
Below, not a whisper was exchanged. Above,
the man poured out his triumphant death-song<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in sonorous periods. Below, great fear was upon
all. Above, the madman exulted wildly.</p>

<p>At first his voice was weak. As he went on
it gained strength and depth. He alluded to
his first address, in which he had hinted that
the material Universe was not quite a success;
to his second, in which he had boldly declared
it was an absolute failure. This, his third declaration,
was to tell us that the remedy as
far as he, a mortal man, could apply it, was
ready. The end was at hand. That night should
see the consummation of his life-work. To-morrow's
sun would rise&mdash;if it rose at all&mdash;on
the earth restored to space.</p>

<p>A shiver passed perceptibly over the people,
prepared as they were for this long foreseen
announcement. Edith Metford, who stood by
me on my left, slipped her hand into mine and
pressed my fingers hard. Natalie Brande, on my
right, did not move. Her eyes were dilated
and fixed on the speaker. The old clairvoyante
look was on her face. Her dark pupils were
blinded save to their inward light. She was
either unconscious or only partly conscious. Now
that the hour had come, they who had believed
their courage secure felt it wither. They, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
people with us, begged for a little longer time
to brace themselves for the great crisis&mdash;the
plunge into an eternity from which there would
be no resurrection, neither of matter nor of mind.</p>

<p>Brande heeded them not.</p>

<p>"This night," said he, with culminating enthusiasm,
"the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous
palaces, the solemn temples, shall dissolve. To
this great globe itself&mdash;this paltry speck of less
account in space than a dew-drop in an ocean&mdash;and
all its sorrow and pain, its trials and temptations,
all the pathos and bathos of our tragic
human farce, the end is near. The way has been
hard, and the journey overlong, and the burden
often beyond man's strength. But that long-drawn
sorrow now shall cease. The tears will be
wiped away. The burden will fall from weary
shoulders. For the fulness of time has come.
This earth shall die! And death is peace.</p>

<p>"I stand," he cried out in a strident voice, raising
his arm aloft, "I may say, with one foot on
sea and one on land, for I hold the elemental
secret of them both. And I swear by the living
god&mdash;Science incarnate&mdash;that the suffering of the
centuries is over, that for this earth and all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
it contains, from this night and for ever, <i>Time
will be no more!</i>"</p>

<p>A great cry rose from the people. "Give us
another day&mdash;only another day!"</p>

<p>But Brande made answer: "It is now too
late."</p>

<p>"Too late!" the people wailed.</p>

<p>"Yes, too late. I warned you long ago. Are
you not yet ready? In two hours the disintegrating
agent will enter on its work. No human
power could stop it now. Not if every particle
of the material I have compounded were separated
and scattered to the winds. Before I set my foot
upon this rock I applied the key which will
release its inherent energy. I myself am powerless."</p>

<p>"Powerless," sobbed the auditors.</p>

<p>"Powerless! And if I had ten thousand times
the power which I have called forth from the
universal element, I would use it towards the issue
I have forecast."</p>

<p>Thereupon he turned away. Doom sounded in
his words. The hand of Death laid clammy
fingers on us. Edith Metford's strength failed at
last. It had been sorely tested. She sank into
my arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Courage, true heart, our time has come," I
whispered. "We start for the steamer at once.
The horses are ready." My arrangements had
been already made. My plan had been as
carefully matured as any ever made by Brande
himself.</p>

<p>"How many horses?"</p>

<p>"Three. One for you; another for Natalie;
the third for myself. The rest must accept the
fate they have selected."</p>

<p>The girl shuddered as she said, "But your interference
with the formula? You are sure it will
destroy the effect?"</p>

<p>"I am certain that the particular result on
which Brande calculates will not take place. But
short of that, he has still enough explosive matter
stored to cause an earthquake. We are not safe
within a radius of fifty miles. It will be a race
against time."</p>

<p>"Natalie will not come."</p>

<p>"Not voluntarily. You must think of some
plan. Your brain is quick. We have not a
moment to lose. Ah, there she is! Speak to
her."</p>

<p>Natalie was crossing the open ground which
led from the glen to Brande's laboratory. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
did not observe us till Edith called to her. Then
she approached hastily and embraced her friend
with visible emotion. Even to me she offered her
cheek without reserve.</p>

<p>"Natalie," I said quickly, "there are three horses
saddled and waiting in the palm grove. The
<i>Esmeralda</i> is still lying in the harbour where we
landed. You will come with us. Indeed, you
have no choice. You must come if I have to
carry you to your horse and tie you to the saddle.
You will not force me to put that indignity upon
you. To the horses, then! Come!"</p>

<p>For answer she called her brother loudly by his
name. Brande immediately appeared at the door
of his laboratory, and when he perceived from
whom the call had come he joined us.</p>

<p>"Herbert," said Natalie, "our friend is deserting
us. He must still cling to the thought that your
purpose may fail, and he expects to escape on
horseback from the fate of the earth. Reason with
him yet a little further."</p>

<p>"There is no time to reason," I interrupted.
"The horses are ready. This girl (pointing as I
spoke to Edith Metford) takes one, I another, and
you the third&mdash;whether your brother agrees or
not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely you have not lost your reason? Have
you forgotten the drop of water in the English
Channel?" Brande said quietly.</p>

<p>"Brande," I answered, "the sooner you induce
your sister to come with me the better; and the
sooner you induce these maniac friends of yours
to clear out the better, for your enterprise will
fail."</p>

<p>"It is as certain as the law of gravitation. With
my own hand I mixed the ingredients according to
the formula."</p>

<p>"And," said I, "with my own hand I altered
your formula."</p>

<p>Had Brande's heart stopped beating, his face
could not have become more distorted and livid.
He moved close to me, and, glaring into my eyes,
hissed out:</p>

<p>"You altered my formula?"</p>

<p>"I did," I answered recklessly. "I multiplied
your figures by ten where they struck me as insufficient."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>I strode closer still to him and looked him
straight in the eyes while I spoke.</p>

<p>"That night in the Red Sea, when Edith Metford,
by accident, mixed morphia in your medicine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The night I injected a subtle poison, which I
picked up in India once, into your blood while
you slept, thereby baffling some of the functions
of your extraordinary brain. The night when in
your sleep you stirred once, and had you stirred
twice, I would have killed you, then and there, as
ruthlessly as you would kill mankind now. The
night I did kill your lieutenant, Rockingham, and
throw his body overboard to the sharks."</p>

<p>Brande did not speak for a moment. Then he
said in a gentle, uncomplaining voice:</p>

<p>"So it now devolves on Grey. The end will be
the same. The Labrador expedition will succeed
where I have failed." To Natalie: "You had
better go. There will only be an explosion. The
island will probably disappear. That will be
all."</p>

<p>"Do you remain?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I perish with my failure."</p>

<p>"Then I perish with you. And you, Marcel,
save yourself&mdash;you coward!"</p>

<p>I started as if struck in the face. Then I said
to Edith: "Be careful to keep to the track.
Take the bay horse. I saddled him for myself,
but you can ride him safely. Lose no time,
and ride hard for the coast."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arthur Marcel," she answered, so softly that
the others did not hear, "your work in the
world is not yet over. There is the Labrador
expedition. Just now, when my strength failed,
you whispered 'courage.' Be true to yourself!
Half an hour is gone."</p>

<p>At length some glimmer of human feeling
awoke in Brande. He said in a low, abstracted
voice: "My life fittingly ends now. To keep you,
Natalie, would only be a vulgar murder." The
old will power seemed to come back to him. He
looked into the girl's eyes, and said slowly and
sternly: "Go! I command it."</p>

<p>Without another word he turned away from
us. When he had disappeared into the laboratory,
Natalie sighed, and said dreamily:</p>

<p>"I am ready. Let us go."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<small>THE FLIGHT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I led</span> the girls hurriedly to the horses. When
they were mounted on the ponies, I gave the
bridle-reins of the bay horse&mdash;whose size and
strength were necessary for my extra weight&mdash;to
Edith Metford, and asked her to wait for
me until I announced Brande's probable failure
to the people, and advised a <i>sauve qui peut</i>.</p>

<p>Hard upon my warning there followed a strange
metamorphosis in the crowd, who, after the passing
weakness at the lecture, had fallen back into
stoical indifference, or it may have been despair.
The possibility of escape galvanized them into
the desire for life. Cries of distress, and prayers
for help, filled the air. Men and women rushed
about like frightened sheep without concert or
any sensible effort to escape, wasting in futile
scrambles the short time remaining to them. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
another half hour had now passed, and in sixty
minutes the earthquake would take place.</p>

<p>"Follow us!" I shouted, as with my companions
I rode slowly through the camp. "Keep the
track to the sea. I shall have the steamer's
boats ready for all who may reach the shore
alive."</p>

<p>"The horses! Seize the horses!" rose in a
loud shout, and the mob flung themselves upon
us, as though three animals could carry all.</p>

<p>When I saw the rush, I called out: "Sit firm,
Natalie; I am going to strike your horse." Saying
which I struck the pony a sharp blow with my
riding-whip crossways on the flank. It bounded
like a deer, and then dashed forward down the
rough pathway.</p>

<p>"Now you, Edith!" I struck her pony in the
same way; but it only reared and nearly threw
her. It could not get away. Already hands were
upon both bridle-reins. There was no help for
it. I pulled out my revolver and fired once, twice,
and thrice&mdash;for I missed the second shot&mdash;and
then the maddened animal sprang forward, released
from the hands that held it.</p>

<p>It was now time to look to myself. I was
in the midst of a dozen maniacs mad with fear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
I kicked in my spurs desperately, and the bay
lashed out his hind feet. One hoof struck young
Halley on the forehead. He fell back dead, his
skull in fragments. But the others refused to
break the circle. Then I emptied my weapon
on them, and my horse plunged through the
opening, followed by despairing execrations. The
moment I was clear, I returned my revolver to
its case, and settled myself in the saddle, for,
borne out of the proper path as I had been, there
was a stiff bank to leap before I could regain
the track to the shore. Owing to the darkness
the horse refused to leap, and I nearly fell over
his head. With a little scrambling I managed
to get back into my seat, and then trotted along
the bank for a hundred yards. At this point
the bank disappeared, and there was nothing between
me now and the open track to the sea.</p>

<p>Once upon the path, I put the bay to a gallop,
and very soon overtook a man and a woman
hurrying on. They were running hand in hand,
the man a little in front dragging his companion
on by force. It was plain to me that the woman
could not hold out much longer. The man, Claude
Lureau, hailed me as I passed.</p>

<p>"Help us, Marcel. Don't ride away from us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot save both," I answered, pulling up.</p>

<p>"Then save Mademoiselle V&eacute;ret. I'll take my
chance."</p>

<p>This blunt speech moved me, the more especially
as the man was French. I could not allow
him to point the way of duty to me&mdash;an Englishman.</p>

<p>"Assist her up, then. Now, Mademoiselle, put
your arms round me and hold hard for your
life. Lureau, you may hold my stirrup if you
agree to loose it when you tire."</p>

<p>"I will do so," he promised.</p>

<p>Hampered thus, I but slowly gained on Natalie
and Edith, whose ponies had galloped a mile before
they could be stopped.</p>

<p>"Forward, forward!" I shouted when within
hail. "Don't wait for me. Ride on at top speed.
Lash your ponies with the bridle-reins."</p>

<p>We were all moving on now at an easy canter,
for I could not go fast so long as Lureau held
my stirrup, and the girls in front did not seem
anxious to leave me far behind. Besides, the
tangled underwood and overhanging creepers
rendered hard riding both difficult and dangerous.
The ponies were hard held, but notwithstanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
this my horse fell back gradually in
the race, and the hammering of the hoofs in
front grew fainter. The breath of the runner
at my stirrup came in great sobs. He was
suffocating, but he struggled on a little longer.
Then he threw up his hand and gasped:</p>

<p>"I am done. Go on, Marcel. You deserve to
escape. Don't desert the girl."</p>

<p>"May God desert me if I do," I answered.
"And do you keep on as long as you can. You
may reach the shore after all."</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;save her!" he gasped, and then from
sheer exhaustion fell forward on his face.</p>

<p>"Sit still, Mademoiselle," I cried, pulling the
French girl's arms round me in time to prevent
her from throwing herself purposely from the
horse. Then I drove in my spurs hard, and,
being now released from Lureau's grasp, I overtook
the ponies.</p>

<p>For five minutes we all rode on abreast. And
then the darkness began to break, and a strange
dawn glimmered over the tree-tops, although the
hour of midnight was still to come. A wild,
red light, like that of a fiery sunset in a hazy
summer evening, spread over the night sky. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
quivering stars grew pale. Constellation after
constellation, they were blotted out until the
whole arc of heaven was a dull red glare. The
horses were dismayed by this strange phenomenon,
and dashed the froth from their foaming muzzles
as they galloped now without stress of spur at
their best speed. Birds that could not sing
found voice, and chattered and shrieked as they
dashed from tree to tree in aimless flight.
Enormous bats hurtled in the air, blinded by
the unusual light. From the dense undergrowth
strange denizens of the woods, disturbed in their
nightly prowl, leaped forth and scurried squealing
between the galloping hoofs, reckless of
anything save their own fear. Everything that
was alive upon the island was in motion, and
fear was the motor of them all.</p>

<p>So far, we saw no natives. Their absence did
not surprise me, for I had no time for thought.
It was explained later.</p>

<p>Edith Metford's pony soon became unmanageable
in its fright. I unbuckled one spur and
gave it to her, directing her to hold it in her
hand, for of course she could not strap it to her
boot, and drive it into the animal when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
swerved. She took the spur, and as her pony,
in one of his side leaps, nearly bounded off the
path, she struck him hard on the ribs. He bolted
and flew on far ahead of us.</p>

<p>The light grew stronger.</p>

<p>But that the rays were red, it would now have
been as bright as day. We were chasing our
shadows, so the light must be directly behind
us. Mademoiselle V&eacute;ret first noticed this, and
drew my attention to it. I looked back, and
my heart sank at the sight. In the terror it
inspired, I regretted having burthened myself
with the girl I had sworn to save.</p>

<p>The island was on fire!</p>

<p>"It is the end of the world," Mademoiselle V&eacute;ret
said with a shudder. She clung closer to me.
I could feel her warm breath upon my cheek.
The unmanly regret, which for a moment had
touched me, passed.</p>

<p>The ponies now seemed to find out that their
safety lay in galloping straight on, rather than
in scared leaps from side to side. They stretched
themselves like race horses, and gave my bay,
with his double burthen, a strong lead. The
pace became terrible considering the nature of
the ground we covered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the harbour came in view. But my
horse, I knew, could not last another mile, and
the shore was still distant two or three. I spurred
him hard and drew nearly level with the ponies,
so that my voice could be heard by both their
riders.</p>

<p>"Ride on," I shouted, "and hail the steamer,
so that there may be no delay when I come
up. This horse is blown, and will not stand
the pace. I am going to ease him. You will
go on board at once, and send the boat back
for us." Then I eased the bay, but in spite of
this I immediately overtook Edith Metford, who
had pulled up.</p>

<p>My reproaches she cut short by saying, "If
that horse does the distance at all it will be by
getting a lead all the way. And I am going
to give it to him." So we started together.</p>

<p>Natalie was waiting for us a little further on.
I spoke to her, but she did not answer. From
the moment that Brande had commanded her
to accompany us, her manner had remained
absolutely passive. What I ordered, she obeyed.
That was all. Instead of being alarmed by the
horrors of the ride, she did not seem to be even
interested. I had not leisure, however, to reflect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
on this. For the first time in the whole race
she spoke to us.</p>

<p>"Would it not be better if Edith rode on?"
she said. "I can take her place. It seems useless
to sacrifice her. It does not matter to me. I
cannot now be afraid."</p>

<p>"I am afraid; but I remain," Edith said resolutely.</p>

<p>The ground under us began to heave. Whole
acres of it swayed disjointed. We were galloping
on oscillating fragments, which trembled beneath
us like floating logs under boys at play. To
jump these cracks&mdash;sometimes an upward bank,
sometimes a deep drop, in addition to the width
of the seam, had to be taken&mdash;pumped out the
failing horses, and the hope that was left to us
disappeared utterly.</p>

<p>The glare of the red light behind waxed fiercer
still, and a low rumbling as of distant thunder
began to mutter round us. The air became difficult
to breathe. It was no longer air, but a
mephitic stench that choked us with disgusting
fumes. Then a great shock shook the land, and
right in front of us a seam opened that must
have been fully fifteen feet in width. Natalie
was the first to see it. She observed it too late
to stop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same mechanical way as she had acted
before, she settled herself in the saddle, struck the
pony with her hand, and raced him at the chasm.
He cleared it with little to spare. Edith's took it
next with less. Then my turn came. Before I
could shake up my tired horse, Mademoiselle V&eacute;ret
said quickly:</p>

<p>"Monsieur has done enough. He will now permit
me to alight. This time the horse cannot
jump over with both."</p>

<p>"He shall jump over with both, Mademoiselle, or
he shall jump in," I answered. "Don't look down
when we are crossing."</p>

<p>The horse just got over, but he came to his
knees, and we fell forward over his shoulder. The
girl's head struck full on a slab of rock, and a faint
moan was all that told me she was alive as I arose
half stunned to my feet. My first thought was for
the horse, for on him all depended. He was uninjured,
apparently, but hardly able to stand from
the shock and the stress of fatigue.</p>

<p>Edith Metford had dismounted and caught him;
she was holding the bridle in her left hand, and
winced as if in pain when I accidentally brushed
against her right shoulder. I tied the horse to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
young palm, and begged the girl to ride on. She
obeyed me reluctantly. Natalie had to assist her
to remount, so she must have been injured. When
I saw her safely in her saddle, I ran back to Mademoiselle
V&eacute;ret.</p>

<p>The chasm was fast widening. From either side
great fragments were breaking off and falling in
with a roar of loose rocks crashing together, till
far down the sound was dulled into a hollow boom.
This ended in low guttural, which growled up from
an abysmal depth. Mademoiselle V&eacute;ret, or her
dead body, lay now on the very edge of the seam,
and I had to harden my heart before I could bring
myself to venture close to it. But I had given
my word, and there were no conditions in the
promise when I made it.</p>

<p>I was spared the ordeal. Just as I stepped
forward, the slab of rock on which the girl lay
broke off in front of me, and, tipping up, overturned
itself into the chasm. Far below I could
see the shimmer of the girl's dress as her body
went plunging down into that awful pit. And
remembering her generous courage and offer of
self-sacrifice, I felt tears rise in my eyes. But
there was no time for tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>I leaped on the bay, and got him into something
approaching a gallop, shouting at the others
to keep on, for they were now returning. When
I came up with them, Edith Metford said with a
shiver:</p>

<p>"The girl?"</p>

<p>"Is at the bottom of the pit. Ride on."</p>

<p>We gained the shore at last; and our presence
there produced the explanation of the absence of
the natives on the pathway to the sea. They were
there before us. Lying prostrate on the beach in
hundreds, they raised their bodies partly from the
sands, like a resurrection of the already dead, and
there then rang out upon the night air a sound
such as my ears had never before heard in my
life, such as, I pray God, they may never listen
to again. I do not know what that dreadful
death-wail meant in words, only that it touched
the lowest depths of human horror. All along the
beach that fearful chorus of the damned wailed
forth, and echoed back from rock and cliff. The
cry for mercy could not be mistaken&mdash;the supplication
blended with despair. They were praying
to us&mdash;their evil spirits, for this wrong had been
wrought them by our advent, if not by ourselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot dwell upon the scene. I could not describe
it. I would not if I could.</p>

<p>The steamer was still in her berth; her head
was pointed seawards. Loud orders rang over the
water. The roar of the chain running out through
the hawse-hole and the heavy splash could not be
mistaken. Anderson had slipped his cable. Then
the chime of the telegraph on the bridge was
followed almost instantly by the first smashing
stroke of the propeller.</p>

<p>The <i>Esmeralda</i> was under weigh!</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<small>THE CATASTROPHE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Esmeralda</i> was putting out to sea when I
thought of a last expedient to draw the attention
of her captain. Filling my revolver with
cartridges which I had loose in my pockets, I
fired all the chambers as fast as I could snap the
trigger.</p>

<p>My signals were heard, and Anderson proved
true to his bargain. He immediately reversed
his engines, and, when he had backed in as close
as he thought safe, sent a boat ashore for us.
We got into it without any obstruction from the
cowering natives, who only shrank from us in
horror, now that their prayers had failed to move
us. The moment our boat was made fast to the
steamer's davit ropes and we were pulled out
of the water, "full speed ahead" was rung from
the bridge. We were raised to the deck while
the vessel was getting up speed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>I crawled up the ladder to the bridge feebly,
for I was becoming stiff from the bruises of the
fall from my horse. Anderson received me coldly,
and listened indifferently to my thanks. An
agreement such as ours hardly prepared me for
his loyalty.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," he interrupted, "when I make
a bargain my word is my bond. On this occasion
I am inclined to think the indenture will
be a final one."</p>

<p>His bargain was a hard one, but, having made
it, he abided faithfully by its conditions. He
was honest, therefore, in his own way.</p>

<p>"How far can you get out in fifteen minutes?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"We may make six or seven knots. But what
is the good of that? There will be an earthquake
on that island on a liberal scale&mdash;on such a scale
that this ship would have very little chance in
the wave that will follow us if we were fifty
miles at sea."</p>

<p>"You have taken every precaution, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anderson here looked at me contemptuously,
and, with an air of sarcastic admiration, he
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have guessed it at the first try. That
is precisely what I have done."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! don't take offence at trifles at a time
like this," I said testily. "If you knew as
much about that earthquake as I do, you would
be in no humour for bandying phrases."</p>

<p>"Might I ask how much you do know about
it? You could not have foreseen the trouble more
clearly if you had made it yourself."</p>

<p>"I did not make it myself, but I know the
means which the man who did employed, and
but for me that earthquake would have wrecked
this earth."</p>

<p>Anderson made no direct answer to this, but
he said earnestly:</p>

<p>"You will now go below, sir. You are done up.
Roberts will take you to the doctor."</p>

<p>"I am not done up, and I mean to see it out,"
I retorted doggedly. My nervous system was
completely unhinged, and a fit of stupid obstinacy
came on me which rendered any interference with
my actions intolerable.</p>

<p>"Then you cannot see it out upon my bridge,"
Anderson said. The determined tone in which
he spoke only added to my impotent wrath.</p>

<p>"Very well, I will return to the deck, and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
any of your men should attempt to interfere with
me he will do so at his peril." With that, I
slung my revolver round so as to have it ready
to my hand. I was beside myself. My conduct
was already bad enough, but I made it worse
before I left the bridge.</p>

<p>"And if you, Anderson, disobey my orders&mdash;my
orders, do you hear?&mdash;an explosion such
as took place in the middle of the English
channel shall take place in the middle of this
ship."</p>

<p>"For God's sake leave the bridge. I want my
wits about me, and I have no intention of earning
another exhibition of your devilries."</p>

<p>"Then be careful not to trouble me again."
Thus after having passed through much danger
with a spirit not unbecoming&mdash;as I hope&mdash;an
English gentleman, I acted, when the worst was
passed, like a peevish schoolboy. I am ashamed
of my conduct in this small matter, and trust it
will pass without much notice in the narrative
of events of greater moment.</p>

<p>On deck, Natalie Brande, Edith Metford, and
Percival were standing together, their eyes fixed
on the island. Edith's face was deathly white,
even in the ruddy glow which was now over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
land and sea. When I saw her pallor, my evil
temper passed away.</p>

<p>"It would be impossible for you to be quite
well," I said to her anxiously; "but has anything
happened since I left you? You are very pale."</p>

<p>"Oh no," she answered, "I'm all right; a little
faint after that ride. I shall be better soon."</p>

<p>Natalie turned her weird eyes on me and said
in the hollow voice we had heard once before&mdash;when
she spoke to us on the island&mdash;"That is
her way of telling you that your horse broke
her right arm when she caught him for you.
She held him, you remember, with her left hand.
The doctor has set the limb. She will not suffer
long."</p>

<p>"Heaven help us, this awful night," Edith
cried. "How do you know that, Natalie?"</p>

<p>"I know much now, but I shall know more
soon." After this she would not speak again.</p>

<p>With every pound of steam on that the
<i>Esmeralda's</i> boilers would bear without bursting,
we were now plunging through the great rollers
of the Arafura Sea. Everything had indeed been
done to put the vessel in trim. She was cleared
for action, so to speak. And a gallant fight she
made when the issue was knit. When the hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of midnight must be near at hand, I looked at
my watch. It was one minute to twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>Thirty seconds more!</p>

<p>The stupendous corona of flame which hung
over the island was pierced by long lines of smoke
that stretched far above the glare and clutched
with sooty fingers at the stars, now fitfully coming
back to view at our distance. The rumbling of
internal thunder waxed louder.</p>

<p>Fifteen seconds now!</p>

<p>Fearful peals rent the atmosphere. Vast
tongues of flame protruded heavenward. The
elements must be melting in that fervent heat.
The blazing bowels of the earth were pouring
forth.</p>

<p>Twelve, midnight!</p>

<p>A reverberation thundered out which shook
the solid earth, and a roaring hell-breath of flame
and smoke belched up so awful in its dread
magnificence that every man who saw it and
lived to tell his story might justly have claimed
to have seen perdition. In that hurricane of incandescent
matter the island was blotted out for
ever from the map of this world.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the speed of the <i>Esmeralda</i>
she was a sloth when compared with the speed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of the wave from such an earthquake. From
the glare of the illumination to perfect darkness
the contrast was sudden and extreme. But the
blackness of the ocean was soon whitened by
the snowy plumes of the avalanche of water
which was now racing us, far astern as yet, but
gaining fast. I, who had no business about
the ship requiring my presence in any special
part, decided to wait on deck and lash myself
to the forward, which would be practically the
lee-side of a deckhouse. Edith Metford we
prevailed on to go below, that she might not
run the risk of further injury to her fractured
arm. As she left us she whispered to me, "So
Natalie will be with you at the end, and I&mdash;"
a sob stopped her. And it came into my mind
at that moment that this girl had acted very
nobly, and that I had hardly appreciated her
and all that she had done for me.</p>

<p>Natalie refused to leave the deck. I lashed her
securely beside me. Together we awaited the end.
When the roar of the following wave came close,
so close that the voices of the officers of the ship
could be no longer heard, Natalie spoke. The
hollow sound was no longer in her voice. Her own
soft sweet tones had come back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arthur," she asked, "is this the end?"</p>

<p>"I fear it is," I answered, speaking close to her
ear so that she might hear.</p>

<p>"Then we have little time, and I have something
which I must say, which you must promise me to
remember when&mdash;when&mdash;I am no longer with you."</p>

<p>"You will be always with me while we live. I
think I deserve that at last."</p>

<p>"Yes, you deserve that and more. I will be
with you while I live, but that will not be for
long."</p>

<p>I was about to interrupt her when she put her
soft little hand upon my lips and said:</p>

<p>"Listen, there is very little time. It is all a
mistake. I mean Herbert was wrong. He might
as well have let me have my earthly span of
happiness or folly&mdash;call it what you will."</p>

<p>"You see that now&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I see it too late, I did not know it until&mdash;until
I was dead. Hush!" Again I tried to
interrupt her, for I thought her mind was wandering.
"I died psychically with Herbert. That was
when we first saw the light on the island. Since
then I have lived mechanically, but it has only
been life in so low a form that I do not now know
what has happened between that time and this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
And I could not now speak as I am speaking save
by a will power which is costing me very dear.
But it is the only voice you could hear. I do not
therefore count the cost. My brother's brain so far
overmatched my own that it first absorbed and
finally destroyed my mental vitality. This influence
removed, I am a rudderless ship at sea&mdash;bound to
perish."</p>

<p>"May his torments endure for ever. May the
nethermost pit of hell receive him!" I said with a
groan of agony.</p>

<p>But Natalie said: "Hush! I might have
lingered on a little longer, but I chose to concentrate
the vital force which would have lasted
me a few more senile years into the minutes
necessary for this message from me to you&mdash;a
message I could not have given you if he were not
dead. And I am dying so that you may hear it.
Dying! My God! I am already dead."</p>

<p>She seemed to struggle against some force that
battled with her, and the roar of many waters was
louder around us before she was able to speak
again.</p>

<p>"Bend lower, Arthur; my strength is failing,
and I have not yet said that for which I am here.
Lower still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"I said it is all a mistake&mdash;a hideous mistake.
Existence as we know it is ephemeral. Suffering
is ephemeral. There is nothing everlasting but
love. There is nothing eternal but mind. Your
mind is mine. Your love is mine. Your human
life may belong to whomsoever you will it. It
ought to belong to that brave girl below. I do
not grudge it to her, for I have <i>you</i>. We two
shall be together through the ages&mdash;for ever and
for ever. Heart of my heart, you have striven
manfully and well, and if you did not altogether
succeed in saving my flesh from premature corruption,
be satisfied in that you have my soul.
Ah!"</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her head as if in
dreadful pain. When she spoke again her voice
came in short gasps.</p>

<p>"My brain is reeling. I do not know what I
am saying," she cried, distraught. "I do not know
whether I am saying what is true or only what
I imagine to be true. I know nothing but this.
I was mesmerised. I have been so for two years.
But for that I would have been happy in your
love&mdash;for I was a woman before this hideous
influence benumbed me. They told me it was
only a fool's paradise that I missed. But I only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
know that I have missed it. Missed it&mdash;and the
darkness of death is upon me."</p>

<p>She ceased to speak. A shudder convulsed her,
and then her head sank gently on my shoulder.</p>

<p>At that moment the great wave broke over the
vessel, whirling her helpless like a cork on the
ripples of a mill pond; lashing her with mighty
strokes; sweeping in giant cataracts from stern to
stem; smashing, tearing everything; deluging her
with hissing torrents; crushing her with avalanches
of raging foam. Then the ocean tornado passed
on and left the <i>Esmeralda</i> behind, with half the
crew disabled and many lost, her decks a mass of
wreckage, her masts gone. The crippled ship
barely floated. When the last torrent of spray
passed, and I was able to look to Natalie, her head
had drooped down on her breast. I raised her face
gently and looked into her wide open eyes.</p>

<p>She was dead.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Taking</span> up my girl's body in my arms, I stumbled
over the wreck-encumbered deck, and bore it to
the state-room she had occupied on the outward
voyage. Percival was too busy attending to
wounded sailors to be interrupted. His services, I
knew, were useless now, but I wanted him to refute
or corroborate a conviction which my own
medical knowledge had forced upon me. The
thought was so repellent, I clung to any hope
which might lead to its dispersion. I waited alone
with my dead.</p>

<p>Percival came after an hour, which seemed to me
an eternity. He stammered out some incoherent
words of sympathy as soon as he looked in my
face. But this was not the purpose for which I
had detached him from his pressing duties elsewhere.
I made a gesture towards the dead girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
He attended to it immediately. I watched closely
and took care that the light should be on his face,
so that I might read his eyes rather than listen to
his words.</p>

<p>"She has fainted!" he exclaimed, as he approached
the rigid figure. I said nothing until
he turned and faced me. Then I read his eyes.
He said slowly: "You are aware, Marcel, that&mdash;that
she is dead?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"That she has been dead&mdash;several hours?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"But let me think. It was only an hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; do not think," I interrupted. "There are
things in this voyage which will not bear to be
thought of. I thank you for coming so soon.
You will forgive me for troubling you when you
have so much to do elsewhere. And now leave us
alone. I mean, leave me alone."</p>

<p>He pressed my hand, and went away without a
word. I am that man's friend.</p>

<p>They buried her at sea.</p>

<p>I was happily unconscious at the time, and so
was spared that scene. Edith Metford, weak and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
suffering as she was, went through it all. She has
told me nothing about it, save that it was done.
More than that I could not bear. And I have
borne much.</p>

<p>The voyage home was a dreary episode. There
is little more to tell, and it must be told quickly.
Percival was kind, but it distressed me to find that
he now plainly regarded me as weak-minded from
the stress of my trouble. Once, in the extremity
of my misery, I began a relation of my adventures
to him, for I wanted his help. The look upon his
face was enough for me. I did not make the same
mistake again.</p>

<p>To Anderson I made amends for my extravagant
display of temper. He received me more
kindly than I expected. I no longer thought of
the money that had passed between us. And, to
do him tardy justice, I do not think he thought of
it either. At least he did not offer any of it back.
His scruples, I presume, were conscientious. Indeed,
I was no longer worth a man's enmity.
Sympathy was now the only indignity that could
be put upon me. And Anderson did not trespass
in that direction. My misery was, I thought, complete.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
One note must still be struck in that long
discord of despair.</p>

<p>We were steaming along the southern coast of
Java. For many hours the rugged cliffs and giant
rocks which fence the island against the onslaught
of the Indian Ocean had passed before us as in
review, and we&mdash;Edith Metford and I&mdash;sat on the
deck silently, with many thoughts in common, but
without the interchange of a spoken word. The
stern, forbidding aspect of that iron coast increased
the gloom which had settled on my brain.
Its ramparts of lonely sea-drenched crags depressed
me below the mental zero that was now
habitual with me. The sun went down in a red
glare, which moved me not. The short twilight
passed quickly, but I noticed nothing. Then
night came. The restless sea disappeared in
darkness. The grand march past of the
silent stars began. But I neither knew nor
cared.</p>

<p>A soft whisper stirred me.</p>

<p>"Arthur, for God's sake rouse yourself! You
are brooding a great deal too much. It will
destroy you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Listlessly I put my hand in hers, and clasped
her fingers gently.</p>

<p>"Bear with me!" I pleaded.</p>

<p>"I will bear with you for ever. But you must
fight on. You have not won yet."</p>

<p>"No, nor ever shall. I have fought my last
fight. The victory may go to whosoever desires
it."</p>

<p>On this she wept. I could not bear that she should
suffer from my misery, and so, guarding carefully
her injured arm, I drew her close to me. And then,
out of the darkness of the night, far over the solitude
of the sea, there came to us the sound of a voice.
That voice was a woman's wail. The girl beside
me shuddered and drew back. I did not
ask her if she had heard. I knew she had
heard.</p>

<p>We arose and stood apart without any explanation.
From that moment a caress would have
been a sacrilege. I did not hear that weird sound
again, nor aught else for an hour or more save
the bursting of the breakers on the crags of
Java.</p>

<p>I kept no record of the commonplaces of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
voyage thereafter. It only remains for me to say
that I arrived in England broken in health and
bankrupt in fortune. Brande left no money.
His formula for the transmutation of metals
is unintelligible to me. I can make no use
of it.</p>

<p>Edith Metford remains my friend. To part
utterly after what we have undergone together is
beyond our strength. But between us there is a
nameless shadow, reminiscent of that awful night
in the Arafura Sea, when death came very near to
us. And in my ears there is always the echo of
that voice which I heard by the shores of Java
when the misty borderland between life and death
seemed clear.</p>

<p>My story is told. I cannot prove its truth, for
there is much in it to which I am the only living
witness. I cannot prove whether Herbert Brande
was a scientific magician possessed of <i>all</i> the
powers he claimed, or merely a mad physicist in
charge of a new and terrible explosive; nor
whether Edward Grey ever started for Labrador.
The burthen of the proof of this last must be
borne by others&mdash;unless it be left to Grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
himself to show whether my evidence is false or
true. If it be left to him, a few years will decide
the issue.</p>

<p>I am content to wait.</p>
